570,Dota is the single greatest video game of all time in my opinion but Valve has ruined it by refusing to update the game in any meaningful way. The only updates we get are AI slop updates that give minor tweaks to heroes like +5 move speed -1 armor or cosmetic slop patches like the most recent one. These patches are essentially humiliation rituals for Dota lifers. Valve is clearly more interested in making more shitty failure games like Artifact instead of allocating more resources into improving an already proven game and e-sport. League of legends has like 180 heroes and Dota only has about 120. Imagine if Valve never wasted any resources on total failure Artifact and dogshit Deadlock and just made more heroes and more frequent more interesting balance patches how great Dota could have become.,138,False,2,0,1762819414,565385,Dota 2,0,

570,"There is nothing tidy about a great Dota match. It’s a plan written in pencil while the table shakes. You queue for one game before bed and somehow you’re counting Roshan minutes at two in the morning, telling yourself that one good smoke can still turn it.

My favorite memory isn’t a rampage or a rapier flip. It’s the quiet after we botched a mid fight, when our offlaner typed “my bad,” pinged a smoke, and cut through the triangle without another word. We wrapped around, took vision, found a single pick, and the whole map felt different. That’s the Dota I love: it breaks you down and then hands you the tools to rebuild if you keep your head.

The design feels honest in a way competitive games rarely do. Every advantage has a window you can actually spot. Every mistake leaves a footprint you can learn from. Neutral items nudge priorities without erasing identity. Buybacks are terrifying, but they are fair, and they create the best late game tension I’ve ever felt. Patches don’t delete your knowledge; they make it evolve.

If you’re new and looking over the wall, you don’t need to know everything. Learn what vision does to a fight. Learn when a smoke is worth more than a stack. Mute fast when you need to. Pick a couple of heroes that make you curious and repeat them until your hands know what your eyes want. One day you’ll pull the wave to reset equilibrium without thinking, and that tiny habit will feel better than any big number on a scoreboard.

To everyone at Valve, from artists to analysts to the people keeping servers breathing on patch night, thank you for treating a free game like a craft project. Dota still feels handcrafted even when it’s loud and messy. Replays, silhouettes you recognize at a glance, the quiet relief of a clean load-in, it all adds up. If there’s one wish, it’s this: keep investing in the first ten hours so more players hit that “I get it now” moment sooner, because once it lands, they aren’t leaving.

I recommend Dota 2 without hesitation. Not because it’s easy, but because it respects the time you give it. It will frustrate you, it will humble you, and then it will hand you a win that sends you to bed smiling at the ceiling. See you at nightfall, smoke ready, buybacks aligned, one good call away from a story worth telling.",413,True,0,0,1762757333,152178,Dota 2,0,

Valve takes their time updating the game but when they do it's extremely innovative and changes the map when League is the most minor of changes.

Yes this game is EXTREMELY difficult but it's a really fun level of difficulty. There's so much to learn and if you come into this game just to try a video game out you will have so much fun. I played a lot of bot games when I started just because I really enjoyed getting to learn some heroes and the map and how mechanics work. It's a very mechanically intensive game but it's not like League where you have to hit your street fighter combo of skill shots to do damage, your hero is very overpowered but so is every hero! So it's really fun, you can feel like a raid boss sometimes. The sound design is incredible, the cosmetics are awesome, Cave JoHnson being an announcer pack makes me smile so much. I wish I can buy the Gaben one! 

This game truly deserves so many more players just because it's actually a really fun video game with a beautiful sandbox where so many new things can happen and any hero and strategy is viable if you put your mind to it and be creative. It's amazing with friends. Please note I have not played ranked yet as I am trying to play a game and win a game on every hero first but even in losses where I get stomped now I still find myself having so much fun. I strongly recommend this game as it is truly the best in the genre and requires you to be open to learning and be uncomfortable which is what life is all about.",344,True,0,0,1762654479,15238,Dota 2,0,

Prevents you for playing for 1 day, moves you to low priority matchmaking queues,  does not allow you to chat (even to plan an attack or anything) and only makes you play I kind of game where you hero is picked randomly. 
Most of the time, Steam will prevent the game from running after a crash and will make you wait 10-20 minutes to ""download content"". I still have no idea what that content is, but you can be sure that after being put into the low priority status, you wont be content for long. 
Overall, the game improves the mechanics of DOTA 1 and delivers fast dopamine, but the punitive system regarding the disconnections is unbearable given the constant crashes. Tried to climb out of the low priority queue, but it is impossible.  it is filled with trash players and the crashes made my situation worst.

I finally gave up and switched to Xbox and Battle.net to play FPS games and you know what? The experience is miles better. Even though steam has a lot of fps titles, I chose to leave it completely because steam and valve have become so unreliable. Their systems feel outdated, their games feel neglected, and the overall experience just isn’t worth it anymore.

What’s even worse is how dota’s integrity keeps falling apart. Even my long time dota friends have quit because the game feels unfair and broken. The matchmaking algorithm is a joke once you go on a win streak, the system suddenly matches you with impossible lineups just to ruin your momentum. It doesn’t matter if you play well or maintain good behavior the algorithm feels punishing instead of rewarding.

And to make things even more frustrating, valve can’t even properly handle account recovery issues. When someone else gets access to your account, you’ll go through endless verification steps. Even if you already have solid evidence proving you’re the real owner, they’ll keep demanding more and more details like they don’t even want to help you recover it. It’s a complete waste of time.

At this point, I’m done. This game sucks, and valve has completely lost its touch. The passion, fairness, and fun that once made dota great are gone. The company doesn’t listen, the support is terrible, and the quality keeps going downhill.

I’ll never use steam or any valve game again. Dota’s legacy is fading fast, and Gen Z players don’t even care about it anymore. valve needs to wake up — because the way things are going, dota is no longer a legend… it’s just another forgotten game.",347,False,0,0,1762509827,243295,Dota 2,0,

Dota 2 is a life decision you will regret, recover from, miss, and then regret again.

You don’t play Dota 2.
Dota 2 plays you.
Your sleep schedule? Gone.
Your mental health? Negotiable.
Your friendships? Depends on whether someone last-picked Techies.

The graphics are nice, the heroes are unique, and the lore is deep—
BUT NONE OF THAT MATTERS
when your carry decides to farm jungle for 42 minutes because “late game we win”.

Every match feels like:

Minute 5: “We got this guys.”

Minute 10: “Mid feeding.”

Minute 15: “Support no wards.”

Minute 20: “Report all.”

Minute 50: “GG go next.”

And somehow, even though you HATE THIS GAME, uninstall it, swear never to return,
Steam will still open by itself like:

“Hey. One game?”

And you will say yes.

Because you are weak.
Because Dota 2 owns your soul.
Because you believe in comeback mechanics that only exist in your imagination.

570,"I’ve been playing Dota 2 for around ten years, and it’s honestly been a huge part of my gaming life. The game has always been about strategy, teamwork, and that feeling of satisfaction when a perfectly executed play turns the tide of a match. Over the years, I’ve seen countless patches, reworks, new heroes, and meta shifts — some great, some frustrating, but always keeping the game alive.

However, lately I’ve found myself feeling… tired. I’m not even sure why — maybe it’s the constant patch changes that make the game feel unstable, or maybe I’ve just lost that spark that kept me logging in every day. The excitement, the thrill of competition, somehow isn’t there anymore.

Don’t get me wrong — Dota 2 is still one of the most complex and rewarding competitive games ever made. It has an amazing community, and the depth of its gameplay is unmatched. But after a decade, I think it’s time for me to take a break.

Maybe someday I’ll return when that passion reignites. For now, though, I’ll just say: thank you, Dota 2, for the memories.

Verdict:
⭐ 8/10 — A legendary game that defined a generation of players. But even legends can lose their magic after too long on the battlefield.",211,True,0,0,1762366704,382714,Dota 2,0,

then all the sudden my game wouldnt go into the hero selection screen then it would kick me out and give me 2 min warning penalty , then again but with a 15 min , then again with a 30 and then a hour , obv i alt f4 and went back to LoL.

my 1st impressions werent great , 2 afk 1st game against actual players , then get thrown into a mini ban because i couldnt get into matches.

For example if pick a sup and the carry is too dumb to make the game a win, you CAN NOT act like a boss and stand up for kills. You gotta just move behind the dumbest core ever till enemy finishes the game in 60 mins. That is what this game has transformed to. A pool of toxicity that when you show creativity, they just throw you to LOW priority. NOW, what is low priority you may ask? Its a match unlike what you installed on your computer. in fact you kinda get to play another game. with only 3 heroes. its a game of chances that this toxic community LOOOOOVEEEES. I've been playing since dota 1. so more than your age probably. I recommend that you don't install this game until they fix the Behavior Score policy. it just ruins your day when you are super niceee and super creative and then coming back to your PC to play a game in which you payed $2000 of skins, and NOPE you can not play this game. you gotta play Single draft with the most stupid players on the surface of this planet till you win 5 matches. and you wont win for like 10 or 12 matches which takes 5 days of a normal human with a JOB ^_^ yeahh. Also the ranking system is super stupid. you just cant win a 1 v 9 game when you get the worst team mates who think of nothing but ruining your experience and revenge on ""why did you tell me to buy wards?"". as Gaben said, he does not care about our feedback.

570,"I learned to love Dota 2 by playing support at 2 AM, buying wards I swore I couldn’t afford, and watching a hopeless lane become winnable because the map finally made sense. This game is a long conversation with your past self. Yesterday you overextended for one more range creep. Today you drag the wave, plant a sentry on instinct, and live to tell the story.

The magic is how cause and effect stay visible. Win a fight near an objective and the whole river tilts in your favor. Lose a fight with buybacks down and you can feel the punishment in your bones. Patches change the surface, but the logic underneath remains readable. If you pay attention, Dota forgives slower than most games, and teaches faster than you expect.

People joke that nothing feels better than a rampage, but my favorite moments are quieter. A smoke that threads the needle between two wards. A carry who trusts a risky call because you pinged it with confidence. A glimpse of a courier path that gives away an ancient stack. These are tiny, human victories that never show up on the scoreboard and somehow matter most.

If you are new, you do not need encyclopedic knowledge. Learn why vision wins fights. Learn that it is okay to trade farm for tempo. Mute early when needed and keep the chat wheel for jokes, not judgment. Pick two or three heroes that make you curious and keep them until your hands know the buttons before your brain does. There is a day when you stop panicking at the minimap and start reading it. That day changes everything.

To the folks at Valve, thank you for making a competitive game that still feels handcrafted. The silhouettes remain readable, the replays are a gift, and the client gets out of the way when it matters. If I could ask for anything, it would be richer first hour guidance and more guardrails around early social friction. The moment someone feels their first real swing of agency, they stay.

I recommend Dota 2 because it stays interesting in the small details long after the big ones are familiar. It is stubborn, brilliant, occasionally infuriating, and somehow the perfect place to spend a late night with four names you may never meet and a plan that might actually work.

By the 30-minute mark, I had gray strands, hand tremors, and a newfound respect for war veterans. My carry told me to uninstall, my support told me to die, and the enemy Sniper shot me from another dimension just to remind me I was never safe.

570,"This game is not for the faint of heart, the young, or the weak-willed. Dota will break you down, then build you up into an entirely different person; and it will do so not through affirmation, communication, or good constructive criticism, but through anguish, pain, and misery.

It is a mountain taller than Mount Everest, steeper than Mount Thor. You will climb alongside, or against billions of other people in a slow, grueling race towards the peak. 

Some choose to stay at the base of the mountain, akin to guardsman testing each and every new climber with skills they have yet to learn, a third of the way to the top. If they don't have what it takes, they'll be stuck at the base and not make any progress. Some will inevitably break and concede, others stubbornly climb back up not knowing what they did wrong, and very few who persisted and passed through into Crusader and beyond.

I say this as an eighteen year old with possible ADHD, do not play this game if you care about your self-esteem and overall physical and mental health. It will waste your life away like an illegal substance.

Herald & Guardian deserve their own special layers in hell. They are filled to the brim with [R-word], [R-word], Narcissists, people who have conditions similar to mine, and more. Live a life that's worth more than wasting five hours a day furiously typing in chat why your offlaner picked Rikimaru, why someone didn't set up vision, or someone delaying the game to sixty minutes despite our team having the necessary equipment and skills to being this close to grasping victory.

There’s no real sense of fair competition anymore — you constantly end up facing Immortal or Divine-level players while you’re supposed to be in Archon ranks.

How to act like a pro:
1. Make sure you have an intimidating nickname ""ex: EZ RAMPAGE""
2. Pick mid carry or gay offlaner that u have GOOD/EXPENSIVE set
3. Say something scary (CapsLock :ON) ""LET ME MID..TY"" or ""I GO SOLO BOTTOM/TOP""
4. Predict win!
5. Just lasthit like a pro (spamming ""S"")
6. When u feed just type ""WTF LAG"", when u got kill/ killsteal remember to laugh on all chat ""HAHAHAHAHA""
7. When u win the game just say ""EZ GAME""

How to cumback the game:
#Normal Strategy
1. Remain calm and def inside.
2. Go rat game! Buy manta/necro and boots of travel.
3. Split push and wards anywhere.
4. Gank their opponent MVP w/ smoke until have no buyback.
5. Final push, there it is!

#TrashTalk Strategy
1. Blame their opponent carry can not fast end or have an ugly profile picture.
2. Call ""ggwp no def, no buyback, end please!""
3. Chat to all, said ur team are noobs and kids!
(there's phase your opponents underestimate your team and goin have fun with silly items build)
""Space created~""
4. Then tells to your team. ""Relax, you're doing fine"", ""Game is hard"", and ""Don't give up!"".
5. Communicate to your team ""we need teamwork"". Who's tanker (blade mail / lotus), innitiator / disabler (dagger), carry / hitter (bkb), support heal / defensive aura (meka / pipe / etc) and rescuer (force staff / glimmer & wards)
""insert your combowombo dream plans here""
6. Dream team here we go.

[b]Dota 2[/b] is a strategic well without a bottom. With over 100 [b]free-to-play[/b] Heroes, every match is a peerless tactical puzzle, demanding flawless mastery of items, timing, and team coordination. It stands as the pinnacle of [b]MOBA[/b] game design.

Valve’s [b]Free-to-Play[/b] model is exceptionally generous; victory is purely skill-based, not wallet-based. While the client is polished and the character designs are vibrant, Dota 2 has a [b]brutally steep learning curve[/b] and a community that can be unforgiving. This game will drown newcomers before they learn to swim.

However, if you persevere, the reward of executing a perfect strategy and watching the enemy Ancient crumble is [/b]one of the most satisfying moments in all of gaming.[/b] This isn't just a game; it's an obsession that will last hundreds, if not thousands, of hours.",142,True,1,0,1761642708,130064,Dota 2,0,

Hours Played: Too many to admit publicly

Dota 2 is the most intense emotional rollercoaster you can experience while sitting perfectly still. One minute you're a godlike tactician leading your team to glorious victory — the next, you’re questioning every life choice that led you to queue “just one more game.”

The gameplay? Addictive. The dopamine hits? Astronomical. The community? …Let’s call it “passionately diverse.” You’ll meet both strategic geniuses and people who make you reconsider free will. But that’s part of the charm — like being yelled at by a teammate you’ll never meet again, yet somehow still remember five years later.

Despite the occasional toxicity and the existential dread of watching your Ancient crumble, nothing quite matches the thrill of landing that perfect combo or pulling off a miraculous comeback.

Play Dota 2.
Lose your sanity.
Gain enlightenment.

Frequent patches keep the meta fresh without deleting everything you learned.

The price of entry is real. The tutorial barely scratches the surface, solo queue can be unforgiving, and the information firehose hits you before you’ve built the mental models to parse it. Long matches also mean every mistake has time to snowball.

570,"My dad left our family.
There were no screams, no conversations — only silence and the sound of the closing door.
When I was little, he used to play Dota all the time. I remembered those sounds — the music, the heroes’ voices — as if they were a part of my childhood. Sometimes he laughed, sometimes he got angry, sometimes he just sat there, staring at the screen, as if everything else stopped existing. He ignored everyone and everything.
Then he left.
Now he plays LoL, and I rarely talk to him.

At first, I just wanted to understand what drew him in so much, why he liked to come home from work and play. But the more I played, the more I realized that Dota is like life — one of the greatest games ever. It has everything: joy, anger, friendship, resentment, gratitude. People here are very different.

Sometimes you meet those who shout, insult, and blame everyone around them — as if they’re venting all the pain from everything that went wrong in their lives. They get mad at you for not building something, for a misplaced ward, or for not dying in a fight. But that’s not the main downside of Dota. Sometimes you meet completely different people — kind, calm, grateful. Someone just says, “Thanks for stacking,” or “Nice play,” and those words warm your heart more than a whole victory.

The more I play, the more I see — Dota isn’t only about fights. It’s about people — kind and angry, grateful and not, reasonable and unreasonable. It’s about what’s inside us. Sometimes it’s not skill or gameplay that matters, but what’s within you. The game depends on people and what kind of atmosphere they create.
If everyone’s kind, understanding, ready to help or give advice — if there’s good communication — you already have a chance to win. With such people, even breathing feels easier. They laugh even when things go badly. They try to joke, to relax. They remind you that it’s just a game — and that maybe life, too, can someday become easier.
And when I hear “Thanks for the game,” something clicks inside me. Because maybe that’s what I’ve always been waiting for — a simple “thank you.” Something my dad never said.

Thanks to Dota, I got closer to someone I love and cherish deeply. We played together, laughed together — he always taught me mechanics. With every game, he came closer.
At first, we were just in a party, just playing. Then it became a habit, a warmth we can’t live without now. Every day, we spend time together, play Dota together. He showed me that even after pain, you can trust again, smile again, live again.
Thanks to Dota, I didn’t just find myself — I found him.
And now, every time I enter the game, I know that among all those players, there’s one person who makes my life meaningful.
The one I treasure.
The one I love.

Good game! Even though some people say, “Dota players are toxic, mean, inadequate,” that’s not true. Not all are like that. Nothing is one-sided — because in each of us, there’s both light and darkness. You can’t live only in light or only in shadow. The same goes for Dota players — there are no purely bad or purely good ones. Good without a touch of evil is nothing. Evil without a spark of good is nothing, too.

And maybe that’s the real magic of Dota — not in winning, but in seeing yourself in others.
Dota is like a mirror, where each time I see not just characters, teammates, or enemies — but emotions, destinies, real people.

Sometimes, while playing, I catch myself thinking that these random teammates are reflections of people from real life.
The one who yells and blames everyone — like my father, tired after work, lost, unable to say he’s hurting.
The one who jokes and supports — like my mother, always ready to warm you even when she’s freezing herself.
And someone stays silent, just doing their job, helping without expecting anything back. And suddenly you realize how little it takes to make the world kinder — just not to stay silent when someone falls. Just to say, “It’s okay, it’s not over, let’s play again.”

Sometimes I think Dota is like therapy.
You queue up again and again, get hurt, frustrated, desperate — but somewhere deep inside, a small spark of hope appears. You learn to accept losses. You learn not to get angry at mistakes — yours or others’. You learn to forgive. You learn to improve.

And the more you play, the more you realize — Dota isn’t about kills, gold, or victory. It’s about character. About not giving up. About how from shouting comes silence, and from chaos comes understanding.
In the game, it’s simple: you either win, or you learn from your mistakes.
In life, it’s harder.

Thanks to Dota, I learned that closeness isn’t always words.
Sometimes it’s just silence in Discord while both of you farm creeps, hearing only the mouse and keyboard.
Sometimes it’s laughing together after a failed gank.
Sometimes it’s the feeling that someone beside you understands you without words — someone who doesn’t judge, doesn’t demand, just is.

We didn’t just play, we lived small lives — each match like a chapter.
There were moments we argued, wanted to mute each other, to leave. But we always came back — because deep inside we knew: without that warmth, without that bond, there’s emptiness.

He became the one who showed me that trust is possible even after betrayal, that you can love not through pain, but through light.
When he said, “Let’s go next,” I heard more than about the game. I heard it about life.
And I went on.

Now, when I enter a match, I don’t look for victory.
I look for the atmosphere where I can breathe.
For those who’ll say “thank you,” for those who won’t leave in silence, for those who’ll remind me I’m not alone.
Each match is like a tiny universe, and each person in it — a star that can light your small path toward something bigger.

If even one person in the game can be kind, then maybe not all is lost in the world.
Because maybe that’s all we’re really looking for — not victory, not recognition, but a simple human “thank you.”

And when the match ends, and the screen says “Victory” or “Defeat,” I smile.
Because I understand — it doesn’t matter. It’s just a game.
The main thing is that I played again, felt again, lived again.
And if life is like a big game of Dota, then I just want to play it honestly — with heart, with those who are near, with those who remember that even in darkness, there’s always a place for light.",1159,True,6,1,1761401519,96614,Dota 2,0,

It can get a bit repetitive at times, but that’s mostly because I’ve played it so much. I really wish they’d bring back Arenas mode — I’ve been hoping for its return every season since it was removed. That said, Mixtape is a fun addition and scratches a bit of that same itch.

1172470,"This game is very special to me, my all-time favorite. Even when I get tired of playing it, I never truly get bored. I first started playing Apex Legends back in 2020 on my old laptop. Sadly, I had to stop because my laptop could no longer handle the game.

After three years, in 2025, I managed to save some money. One day, I saw a TikTok video of someone playing Apex, and it instantly brought back all the memories. That’s when I decided to buy a computer and start playing again. When I finally did, I was so happy it felt like I was reunited with something I truly loved.

But just recently, something unfortunate happened my account got permanently banned because I got into arguments and trash-talked other players. When that happened, I felt really sad and deeply regretted my actions. All my memories and rare weapon skins were gone, just like that.

Still, nothing can stop me. I created a new account and decided to begin my Apex Legends journey all over again. This time, I’ll play with a better attitude and more respect toward others.

To everyone who struggles with anger issues, my advice is this: never release your anger in the game. You might end up like me banned for something that could have been avoided. Peace!

Lastly, I highly recommend Apex Legends to anyone who loves FPS games. It’s truly one of the best, most thrilling games you’ll ever play. Once you start, you’ll understand why it’s so special.",255,True,0,0,1762754489,19181,Apex Legends™,0,

There is no other game you'll find that has the type of gameplay that apex does and that's what makes it so addicting despite it's plentiful issues, especially lately. Which brings me to it's issues. Once covid hit, EA decided to take the reins of apex more than it ever had before and they laid off a lot of the devs that actually put their heart into the game. Now the game is one massive cash grab.

1172470,"Apex Legends in 2025 remains a technically strong and mechanically satisfying battle royale. Players still praise its fast, fluid movement, tight gunplay, and the distinct personalities of its Legends. It continues to stand out for its dynamic combat and teamwork-focused gameplay, proving that its core design has aged remarkably well.

However, the community’s overall mood has shifted toward frustration. Many players criticize the current monetization model, calling it overly aggressive and out of touch with the fanbase. The battle pass changes, high-priced cosmetics, and frequent limited-time bundles have pushed even long-time players away. Matchmaking is another recurring issue, with many reporting uneven matches and a steep skill gap that makes solo play punishing.

While technical stability has improved — with fewer major server issues and better hit registration — the player base has noticeably declined, especially on Steam. This has led to longer queue times in some regions and less consistent lobbies.

Despite these problems, Apex Legends still delivers when everything clicks: fast-paced fights, smooth mechanics, and moments of teamwork that few games can match. It’s clear the core of Apex is still brilliant — it’s just buried under decisions that many players feel have hurt the experience.

Verdict:
A once-great battle royale that still shines mechanically but is weighed down by heavy monetization and inconsistent matchmaking. A solid shooter at its core, but one that’s lost some of its spark in 2025.",233,True,0,0,1762631413,9891,Apex Legends™,0,

The teamwork aspect is where Apex really shines — coordinating abilities, reviving teammates, and making split-second decisions gives every match its own story. The ping system is still one of the best in gaming, making communication easy even without a mic.

The visuals are stunning, the sound design is top-notch, and the movement system makes every moment feel fluid and fast-paced. Respawn continues to show dedication to improving the game with balance changes and community feedback.

I am currently level 300+ and won 10 victories at least 1 per hour. The grind and predatory microtransactions is unreal. You would need to play 300+ hours just to unlock a single Legend as a F2P. It's P2W due to the fact that certain Legends are locked behind a paywall and you would need to pay actual money to actually enjoy it and gain an advantage.

Respawn is definitely using bots ingame which explains why nobody voice chats or even chats at all. I had bots literally walking slowly towards me in the first 3 minutes of the match. I had a bot hiding in a corner only to shoot several warning shots at it. No reaction. No melee attacks. No running. Nothing.

1172470,"Игра Apex Legends™ – динамичный и затягивающий батл рояль с уникальными персонажами, каждый из которых обладает своими способностями. Геймплей очень плавный, механика стрельбы отточена до блеска, и командная работа здесь играет ключевую роль.

Выбор легенд с разнообразными навыками позволяет создавать интересные комбинации и менять тактику в зависимости от обстоятельств. Карта хорошо продумана, а частые обновления добавляют новое оружие, режимы и события, поддерживая интерес к игре.

Apex Legends™ выгодно отличается от других батл роялей благодаря более быстрому темпу игры и инновационной системе возрождения товарищей по команде. Это не просто выживание, а тактическое противостояние, требующее от игроков быстрого принятия решений и слаженного взаимодействия.

Несмотря на периодические проблемы с балансом некоторых легенд, игра остается одной из лучших в своем жанре. Бесплатность также является большим плюсом, позволяя каждому попробовать себя в роли легенды Apex Games.

1172470,"Despite trying more or less every other ""Battle Royale"" on the market over the years, Apex always eluded me, there was always this soft sense of 'bitterness' over the fact that Titanfall 2 was launched in a horrible window and Titanfall 3 as a concept, was completely abandoned, all to pave way for a trend-chasing Battle Royale game instead.

[b]Fast-forward to 2025 and that juvenile bitterness has subsided so, I figured I'd give it a go.[/b]

What I found was no Titanfall 3, but still an incredibly competent and charming FPS, with a host of awesome looking and sounding characters, all diverse in their skill-sets and abilities, with great looking guns and satisfying gun-play. I don't have thousands of hours to fall back on or 'the good old days' glasses to wear. As a new player, I think this is a cracking game and I've enjoyed every match, win-or-lose, frustration or not.

The game is, as expected, heavily monetised and it's been out for quite some time. They also run loot-boxes in the form of Apex packs and have these absolutely ridiculous 'collection events' which could have you spending hundreds of pounds, dollars etc, just to have a chance of getting a unique 'heirloom' relevant to that event. I think it's ridiculous personally.

I also think the experience is brought down by having only three-stacks at maximum. I think quads should definitely be a thing in all honesty, but I don't know how that'd effect team-fight balancing and I'm just a scrub at the end of the day.

Most heroes are locked which, feels weird, but as a new player, that gives the 'spotlight passes' some value. Basically, they're tiny battle pass progression tracks for each character you can pay for. Buying them unlocks the character, a host of cosmetics for that character, a gun cosmetic, some other packs, crafting materials and, if you need help on the battle pass, around 5 or so levels worth of stars, I think. Good for someone new wanting to pad out their cosmetic locker AND unlock heroes, mid-bad value for long term players though I'd say.

Honestly, I thoroughly enjoy this one, probably more so than any other Battle Royale I've played. I jumped into it late, but I'm glad I did, easily a steady game in my live-service rotation now and the only BR title I will play going forward, regardless of updates to other games, or new and shiny BR experiences that may or may not come out.

TL:DR for people with a bit of brain-rot / short attention spans : Game good, not jaded by good ol' days or loads of hours played over the years. Having a good time with it, best BR I've played of the bunch.",459,True,2,0,1762307619,9180,Apex Legends™,0,

1172470,Ah yes apex Legends. I know i only have 70 hours on pc but on ps5 and xbox i have together 5k and maybe more hours on this game im a day one player at that too lol. Apex was and is (kinda) fun it depends on what you are looking for its not very new player friendly unless you played apex when it first came out. Movement wise is great best movement from a game. I think what makes this game not fun anymore is skill and PROS and twitch streamers i get everyone wants to be famous and stuff but god. So dont be surprise when you get killed by a TTV or KICK person. I say skill because you got to at least know how to wall jump or bunny hop and i barely know how to which is crazy. BALANCING in this game is just bad they really only listen to pro or base it off of ALGs there will be times when they do listen but thats if the normal people say it and the pros say it too sadly. So when it comes to who they will listen to keep a eye out. MONEY i know its like hitting a dead horse but skins is very expensive for one skin its at least 20 to 30 dollars you can have the skin or the gun they will discount for 5 dollars off lol. Heirlooms i feel like this is the only thing that keep this game alive (kinda) but its bad you have to spend 160 oh wait its 200 or 260 yeah dont get no event with a heirloom. I feel like they should give out at least one time a free heirloom just one just saying man it will bring back some people. i have retired from apex it brings a lot of stress after work and i just want to relax not rage plus my gf and family dont play this anymore btw soloing in this game SUCKS.

1172470,"Lets talk about apex legends....  This game launched back in February of 2019, and man oh man it was a hit. That being said Respawn did everything in their power to destroy it so lets talk about it.

1. The movement.....
I'm not normally a huge fan of the extreme fast paced movement but Titanfall had it perfect and when Apex Legends came out they nailed perfectly. It felt fun and exciting but now, not so much chief.
You see I'm not sure why they did it but they went and made Apex Legends, Chunky Legends. I'm not sure if this was a community complaint or or a ranked complaint or even Respawn just sippin the juice too hard but this feels horrible now. It just kills the parkour and sprint feature, I shouldn't have to slide down a hill for a boost in speed. 

2. The guns.....
Respawn did this really cool thing where they brought all the guns from Titanfall and just molested them.
You see they went and looked into the fan favorite weapons and nerfed the life out of them to switch up the meta, but the weapons were fine! Honestly this wouldn't be a bad thing if they buffed them after a while but that's just it, they never get buffed back! Every gun feels like a I'm hitting them with with pillows. You're forced to just puke all your ammo out on one guy because every time you do damage he just runs away and shields back up and rinse and repeat until one of you either runs out of shields or ammo. You make a competitive game and then try to hard to make it  ""player friendly"" and just turned it into a bullet hose arena

3.The characters.
(this one is my personal opinion so feel free to blow past this one) There are so many characters and they cost an arm and a leg to unlock. Half of them are absolutely useless and feel like gimics. The skins are kinda cringe too at times, not all of them but most of them.

4.The Store...
I know the game is free and the store is where they make money but the prices on the items, oh my god.
like 20+ dollars for a majority of the items in the store. It just feels scummy and it's giving wallet reaching big time. Respawn is just becoming activision 2.0.

I think that wraps it up for me. This game used to be such a gem but like all things on earth, aging kills (unless your a lobster) It does feel sad though because this game really speed ran the whole ""killing my own community"" strat within a year I would say. They already announced that there wasn't gonna be a Titanfall 3 so this was the only brainchild in the works to my knowledge which just feels like the thing they care about is collecting card info now and not the Titanfall arena experience this game is built around. Stay away from this game and let it go peacefully into the night. Lest Respawn does anymore harm before it does.",525,False,1,0,1762152681,1895,Apex Legends™,0,

1172470,"In the first summer of its launch, the game originally drew me in with its story, characters, and universe. It had a gritty and interesting style of storytelling that eventually got me into Titanfall 2 -- now one of my sci-fi story loves. Unfortunately, my love affair with Apex Legends' storytelling and universe has long since been on the decline ever since they've been whittling down their writing team; most of the narrative/writing direction have now left and gone on to other, better prospects. The love that used to go into the community is now nonexistent compared to the days they had a social media/community manager that EA then fired. A lot of characters now fall into the Overwatch trap of getting released constantly and then receiving zero lore/attention.

In terms of technical stuff, the game was buggy in its initial years of launch, and now is *mostly* stable for most people. Unfortunately, it is not optimised for everyone, and I am in that camp. Most days I'm unable to launch this game without opening it 4-5 times. Getting constant lag warnings (literally all the symbols) in most games and on most days, with fibre internet and an all right PC. 

The biggest joke is that I'm still playing this game, but I like shooting things + I hate change and seeking out new media.

The matchmaking is horribly unfair, putting me in lobbies with either people who I wipe out easily or putting me in lobbies with preds that somehow smelled worse than me.
The ranked system also sucks. Placement is waaaay above getting kills, so final zone will tend to have like 10 teams in it all sitting in corners of the zone trying to widdle the other teams down. This made the grind so incredibly boring, and for a game that has such great movement, it's a waste that half the game in ranked is spent standing in a corner.
It also just has the curse of shitty random teammates, so if you REALLY want to download this game in the big 25, get 2 others to play with you.

1172470,"💥🏃‍♂️ BROOO APEX LEGENDS ITU ROYALE PALING CEPAT, PALING CHAOTIC, DAN PALING STYLISH! 💥

Bayangin lo dilempar ke arena futuristik, 60 orang saling bunuh demi jadi yang terakhir berdiri. Tapi bedanya, ini bukan battle royale biasa, ini parkour, skill, dan teamwork dalam satu paket gila!

⚡ Gameplay? FUSION ANTARA SPEED & STRATEGY!
Lo bisa sliding ngebut di lereng, zipline dari atap ke atap, trus tiba-tiba flank musuh dari arah nggak terduga. Setiap karakter punya skill unik dari healer, trap master, sampe teleport ninja. Lo nggak cuma nembak, tapi juga ngerencanain tiap langkah kayak taktik perang modern.

🔫 Gunplay-nya? CLEAN BANGET.
Recoil-nya terasa realistis, tiap senjata punya feel dan suara khas. Dari Wingman yang satisfying banget pas kena headshot, sampe R-99 yang literally nyemprot peluru kayak air mancur.

🤝 SQUAD PLAY = INTI SEGALANYA.
Main sendiri sih bisa, tapi Apex itu hidup dari kerjasama tim. Lo bakal saling cover, ping lokasi musuh, revive temen di tengah hujan peluru, dan panik bareng pas ring udah nutup. Komunikasi di sini tuh hal paling penting dan paling chaos juga. 😂

🎨 VISUAL & MAP? BERASA FUTURISTIK TAPI HIDUP.
Dari gurun Kings Canyon sampe kota neon di Olympus, semua map-nya detail banget. Warna vibrant, efek ability keren, dan design karakternya bergaya sci-fi yang beda banget dari battle royale lain.

🎵 AUDIO = CLUTCH MOMENT MAKER.
Suara langkah musuh, zipline, atau ultimate Horizon yang mulai aktif, semuanya bisa jadi bedain hidup dan mati. Headset wajib, bro.

🌟 Rating: 9/10
Apex Legends = battle royale buat lo yang suka adrenalin tinggi, teamwork solid, dan gameplay secepat kilat. Gue balik dulu, masih ada squad yang nge-hold high ground. Wish me luck, bro. Octane gue udah siap ngebut! 🏃‍♂️💨💥",280,True,0,0,1761882413,2291,Apex Legends™,0,

This is a unique game, meaning if you are the average cod playing Joe, u won't just be a god here with good aims. The healing system is slower than in cod, so you cant just fully reheal mid fight, here u need to have an edge. Maps are more punishing meaning, there is always cover, but there are massive walls on every map so u need to be careful where u rotate otherwise u are going to be stuck outside. Weapons are solid, not huge recoil, its learnable. Movement is interesting, because at first it feels extremely rigid, then when u learn what to do and how, it can be really fast and fluid. 

What I want to say: this is a skill needed game, I think more than cod. Plus in its current state it is kinda abandoned by devs, but it runs, finds matches fast and that is about enough.",175,True,0,0,1761830844,2120,Apex Legends™,0,

No matter your rank you will play against the second highest rank 80% of the time. Skill based matchmaking? You mean pretending your skill is so high you should only play against the best is what I was hoping you wanted. It's nice to watch videos on how to get better with this game, since the skill ceiling is so high you can't even see it, and you start getting a hang of how to play, and then the up and coming pro teams laser you from the other side of a poi and some how teleports behind you and infront of you simultaneously. You figure it's a fluke and after 5 hours of this ragebait simulator, you realize this is every game.

How about the meta and legends and loot pool. As another reviewer said, it's like they threw darts on a board and picked what they hit. The most random legends are buffed to god status and random ones are nerfed so much their pick rate hits zero. The unfortunate issue with the legends is that most players like only a few gameplay types so nearly half of the legends don't get much use. Instead of reworking these legends, EA decides to let them be or do the aforementioned buffing/nerfing at insane levels. We don't need a new meta based solely on the use of one legend. Games with win conditions are not fun at all. You don't have the latest legend that go so buffed they make you want to leave the match before you get obliterated? Guess you need to get better and try again.

The guns aren't any better. EA takes out random weapons from the loot pool, and will redesign a gun or two and make them so powerful they become win conditions. They also refuse to balance anything. Both the legends and guns are not balanced to any extent. Some guns become crutches, others win conditions, and some are so bad most people refuse to pick them up even if they need a gun. The devs really don't give a fart about making the game balanced or really interesting. Content only comes from these legend and gun changes. I guess if you like gambling and maxing out credit cards then there might be content for you. Pixels are worth $360 - $1000 trust me.

If you are okay with the points mentioned above then download the game and play it, it is true that there is no other game like apex legends with its unique movement, but at the same time there isnt any other game with the same amount of BUGS microtransactions Expensive events more than 20 Mythic skins obtainable only and only after opening 500 packs.

1172470,"Reached 5555.5 hours of Apex Legends on Steam, and I also played some good amount on console, mobile and EA app. 

So far I have 0.5 KD, which grows roughly by 0.1 each 1000 hours I play. I started S10 on PC, then played on XBOX and got Diamond on S12, then switched back to PC and got Plat same Season, and couldn't get past Gold next one. 

Almost completely didn't play S14, because I played Apex mobile, and got there Master on both First Person and Third Person modes. It was infested with PC players on emulators, speed hackers, etc. 

As for maps, I experienced first version of Worlds Edge and Kings Canyon for the first time, as I started Apex late. I tried Apex for very first time on S5, on console, played a little, but at that time, my main game was Fortnite. 

I played Fortnite about 1.9K hours, about two years, which I also played late - since Season X, and reason I seriously started Apex, was because Fortnite pissed me off on about Chapter 3... 

At first I liked it, but then I just rage quit it, since Spiderman gloves allowed people just to run away so fast, and also run up to you from nowhere. And they kept adding similar non-stop grapplers after that too. 

Plus I aslo encountered cheaters, and they also went live on Tik Tok spinning around their axis, one shotting people through terrain, teleporting accross the map... 

I've seen also Apex cheaters streaming about that time, with multicolored lines pointing to each player... But somehow I sticked to Apex. That's my comfort game, where I get my neurodivergent AuDHD mind enough of novelty each game, and not so much change, at the same time, as I play the same game, which thankfully doesn't change so much season to season, as Fortnite. 

Thank you for being my main game (95% of my gaming) for last four years! 

If I could ask something, I'd love to have Apex music from all seasons. You can add it on shop. Sure, I can play them on YouTube, but I love how music is built for game, when there is loading it's one theme, when you start drop, it plays main part, and when you win, it's also different. 

Thank you Respawn team for making this game cool and awesome! 

P.S. I have also played around with Unreal Engine 5, and would be honored to create some level design/map design together with you, if you consider my time spent in game and passion for it would help.",432,True,1,0,1761649263,338007,Apex Legends™,0,

1172470,"The Ultimate Apex Legends Review (2025 Edition)

Introduction

Apex Legends, Respawn Entertainment's free-to-play battle royale, has evolved significantly since its 2019 debut. As of late 2025, the game continues to captivate players with its dynamic gameplay, diverse roster of Legends, and ever-evolving content. However, with its complexity and competitive nature, questions arise about its suitability for younger audiences.

Gameplay and Mechanics

Apex Legends distinguishes itself with its unique blend of fast-paced combat, strategic team play, and hero-based abilities. Players select from a roster of Legends, each with distinct skills that influence team dynamics and strategy. The game's movement system, including sliding, climbing, and ziplining, offers fluid and responsive controls, enhancing player immersion.

The introduction of the ""Wildcard"" mode in Season 26 allows players to stack Legends, creating opportunities for innovative strategies and dynamic gameplay. Additionally, the game's seasonal updates, such as the Prodigy season, introduce new characters and balance changes to keep the gameplay fresh and engaging.

Graphics and Audio

Apex Legends features a stylized art direction with vibrant environments and detailed character models. While the visuals are appealing, some players have reported issues with the game's audio, particularly regarding sound cues and spatial awareness, which can impact the overall experience. Despite these concerns, the game's visual design remains a strong point.

Community and Social Interaction

The game's online multiplayer nature fosters a strong community, with players collaborating in teams to achieve victory. However, this also exposes players to potential negative interactions, such as toxic behavior and harassment. While the game includes features like voice chat and team communication, it's essential for players to be aware of the social dynamics and take precautions when engaging with others online.

Is Apex Legends Suitable for Kids?

Apex Legends is rated ""T for Teen"" by the ESRB, indicating it's appropriate for players aged 13 and older. The game includes content descriptors for blood, violence, and interactive elements, such as online communication and in-game purchases. While the violence is stylized and not overly graphic, the game's competitive nature and online interactions may not be suitable for younger children.

Parents should consider the game's content and the potential for exposure to online interactions when determining if it's appropriate for their children. It's advisable to monitor gameplay and set appropriate boundaries to ensure a positive gaming experience.

Conclusion

Apex Legends remains a premier choice for players seeking a competitive and engaging battle royale experience. Its unique gameplay mechanics, diverse Legends, and regular content updates keep the game fresh and exciting. However, its complexity and online nature necessitate consideration regarding its suitability for younger audiences. Parents should assess the game's content and social interactions to determine its appropriateness for their children.

Final Verdict

Apex Legends continues to be a top-tier battle royale game, offering a blend of strategic depth and fast-paced action. While it provides an engaging experience for players aged 13 and above, its complexity and online interactions may not be suitable for younger audiences. Parents should consider the game's content and social dynamics when determining its appropriateness for their children.",640,True,0,0,1761603693,3933,Apex Legends™,0,

Apex Legends is a game that can be so much fun, but it has one of the highest skill curves of any competitive shooter I have played. Its predecessor TItanfall, especially Titanfall 2, is one of the best shooters and stories of all time. 
Respawn Entertainment makes great games, but with EA having so many transactions for cosmetics, their servers being garbage, and the high skill gap, you have to spend so so so many hours to get very good at the game.

UI is not very intuitive and is clunky with sub menus to get where you need but I guess with enough time you memorize where things are. 

gun play and movement are what keeps this game afloat.  Most things are polished at this point and are pretty smooth.  But the next big battle royal with good movement and gun play will kill this game and BF6 will prob do this when they make their BR.

And who wants your DEI stuff crammed down our throats?? Just make a game where you shoot people and stay out of performative character design, no one wants that esp the voice lines... its such a turn off.  

This game has slowly been dying and getting worse and worse as the years go on, they forgot they are supposed to just make a good FPS BR.

1172470,"💥 Apex Legends (2025) Review — The King Still Reigns 👑

Even after six years, Apex Legends proves why it’s still one of the best live-service shooters on the planet. Respawn has somehow kept that signature adrenaline-fueled magic alive — slick gunplay, iconic Legends, and world-class movement that most competitors still can’t touch.

Season after season, Apex feels like a masterclass in balance between chaos and control. The moment you slide into a gunfight, zipline across a rooftop, or clutch a 1v3 with the perfect grenade — it just clicks. The rhythm, the sound design, the smoothness… there’s still nothing quite like it. 🎯

2025’s new content cycle has been surprisingly generous too. From the Wildcard events to legend reworks that actually feel impactful, Respawn is listening again — and it shows. Server stability, hit detection, and ranked pacing all feel tighter than they’ve been in years.

And let’s be honest — no other battle royale has characters this stylish or lore this rich. Each Legend feels alive, with personality oozing out of every animation and voice line. Whether you main Wraith, Catalyst, or the latest powerhouse, there’s always a reason to jump back in.

Apex in 2025 isn’t just surviving — it’s thriving. The competition keeps trying to copy its DNA, but Apex Legends still wears the crown. 👑🔥

Verdict: 9.5 / 10
Apex Legends remains the GOAT of movement shooters — fast, beautiful, and endlessly fun. Long live the arena. 💀💫",243,True,0,0,1761464048,78969,Apex Legends™,0,

1172470,EA has made a good game but the player base is a constant nuisance. Players have found multiple ways to cheat and not get banned and that makes this game almost unplayable. If you are new and try to play this game you'll find yourself in a public lobby with low levels who hour per hour have better stats than all pro players..I hope if you decide to play this game its after the cheater issue has been resolved. The player base is also so toxic that if you even assume someone is cheating they will call you names and say skill issue. I understand the nature of the internet but it is confirmed that almost half of the entire top ranking predator and masters were banned for cheating in one season alone. It is a travesty what this game has become. Thank you Buh-bye,145,False,8,0,1761340060,6544,Apex Legends™,0,

1172470,"This game is utterly terrible. The developers evidently show no interest for the player community. Each update somehow manages to break the game further. They attempt to ""balance"" elements with no logical reasoning. It seems as if they randomly throw darts at a board and label it as patch notes. The map sometimes feels like it has been generated by an AI. As for the servers? They are absolutely awful. There is lag, persistent instability, and frequently, players are kicked from matches mid game which happened to me a few times.

Now about their so called ""updates."" They are merely pretexts to force more overpriced cosmetics onto the player base. It is absurd. They buff a character like Mad Maggie, conveniently launching a flashy new skin for her and then exploit it while players rush to purchase it. The following season, the cycle repeats with another character. It is shameless.

Since the last update where they completely ruined how players drop into the map, the game’s been a total disaster. Now you don’t even get to choose you’re just thrown into some ""random"" pre-selected spot, like it or not. Wonder why I marked out random? Because almost always it's not even random I noticed how you basically always drop at the same 2-3 places even tho there's like 10 others. And the best part? You constantly get the “You are being invaded” message even when literally no one is dropping near you. It’s been like this since the start of the update, and they haven’t fixed it, mentioned it, or even acknowledged it. Just another perfect example of how little the devs actually care about the game or its players.

Then they have recently transformed the Peacekeeper which was once a rare and powerful airdrop weapon into a standard firearm that pretty much wasn't nerfed at all. Now, every match feels identical. The same broken weapons the same two or three characters that are being played while all the other characters are not being touched at all. The developers appear to be either inactive or entirely absent. This game has devolved into monotonous chaos. Unstable and entirely motivated by greed.",360,False,2,0,1761334296,36079,Apex Legends™,0,

Anyway I'm writing this review more to talk about something weird that happened after I installed this. When I was like fourteen I played this for a dozen or so hours on an Xbox one and got some levels and experience and all that. I promptly forgot about the game until I decided to try it again a few months ago to play it with someone. (Note that I have never put Apex on my PC before.)

After the install and setup process, which was done entirely with me connected to a VPN, I was greeted with an account that was already level thirteen. I wasn't prompted to sign in or anything like that beforehand. I already had skins from season two or three for some weapons and some skins for a few of the operators.

Then I realized, the game knew it was me and put me in my old account?? (I think??) I played a few matches after that point and eventually ran into one other person who said he had a similar experience.

No clue what causes this but there's only so many possibilities here. Wtf EA???",208,False,1,0,1761206493,154,Apex Legends™,0,

Apex Legends is a fast-paced, team-based battle royale where communication is key. This is great, because my random teammates are usually mute philosophers or 12-year-olds screaming in a dialect not known to mankind.

I land, I loot, I get third-partied within 45 seconds by a squad using every meta gun Respawn forgot to nerf. Then I get to watch my teammate crouch-walk around the edge of the zone with four Mozambiques and the game sense of a toaster.

And the ranked system? It’s a social experiment designed to test how many hours a human being can waste while slowly being demoted by people playing like NPCs with a ping of 900.

Movement? Amazing.
Gunplay? Slick.
Servers? Held together by chewing gum and hope.
Cheaters? Somewhere between ""occasional nuisance"" and ""entire population of the match.""

1172470,"[u]NOTE: I haven't played in a while so this is based on my past experiences.[/u]

I've never seen the appeal of Battle Royale games and this was the first one I had ever played and it was just because my friends wanted me to.


I had a problem on day two of playing the game: after finishing a session the game wouldn't close itself, steam couldn't close it, Task Manager couldn't close it, powershell couldn't close it. I couldn't even shutdown or restart my PC. So I had to force a shutdown which, [i] somehow[/i], completely broke my Windows installation. So instead I installed it on Linux and played for a while, on and off for a couple of months. 
It isn't much fun to play solo so if your friends- like mine did- switch to a new game and if you're like me, you'll have little reason to play it.

[h2]The Good[/h2]

The gunplay is pretty good but some of the guns feel a bit meh. Like most games, the devs struggle to properly balance them, at least from my short experience and anecdotes from my friends.
The movement is fantastic, genuinely some of the most fun movement mechanics in any FPS I've ever played and yes, I [b] will[/b] eventually play Titanfall 2 before anyone points out it's basically/exactly the same.

[h2]The Bad[/h2]

The Monetization of the game is disgusting, it was probably the most expensive mainstream game for cosmetics at the time, especially for the high tier stuff, iirc and I could be wrong with this analogy, to get the best of the best stuff it would be like if you had to own every Pokemon card released in a series before you were even permitted to PAY for the most expensive card. 
It used to be that you could pay for the first battlepass and as long as you played the entirety or majority of the battlepass you'd have earned enough premium currency to pay for the next but according to people I know whom still play (and the tons of videos people made complaining about this change when it happened), that is no longer the case.
If you do still play it, don't give them any money. If they stop getting money, things get cheaper, then you can consider buying something if you want to. Meaningless cosmetics only keep getting more and more expensive is because people still pay for them, if everyone voted with their wallet, they would be forced to lower the price.

[h2]The Inconsequential[/h2]

Long after I stopped playing the game they made the decision to disable access to Linux players and since I am certainly never going to play this on Windows because it broke my previous installation, now I can't even play it on Linux if I wanted to (also W10 is dead and W11 is trash, so that doesn't help). They blocked Linux users because, according to developers a ""significant amount of cheaters were using Linux"" (Not verbatim). Which sucks for legitimate players but oh well. I do not know if the game has improved after these changes or not, ask someone who still plays. I had already quit a long time ago so I didn't care too much, though I did have two achievements left to get which sucks.


[h2] The tl;dr [/h2]avoid, there are better games around, maybe check it out if you start seeing a plethora of new people talking about 'how good it is now' if that ever happens. Not bad for my first and only experience of a battle royale game but poorly handled, definitely hasn't made me want to play any other Battle Royale games as I actually much preferred the Arena mode.",620,False,1,0,1760947046,5296,Apex Legends™,0,

1172470,"Apex Legends is an absolute gem of a battle royale game that has kept me hooked for over 1,000 hours. The fast paced gameplay, slick movement mechanics, and diverse roster of Legends make every match feel fresh and exhilarating. The gunplay is crisp, rewarding skill and strategy, while the ping system and team focused design make it a blast to play with friends or even random squads.

My favorite Legend, Valkyrie, is a game changer. Her jetpack mobility lets you soar above the chaos, reposition with ease, and scout enemy squads like a pro. Her tactical and ultimate abilities add such a dynamic layer to gameplay, whether you're raining missiles or launching your team to a new vantage point. She perfectly embodies the high-flying, aggressive playstyle I love.

The constant updates, vibrant maps, and evolving meta keep Apex feeling alive and engaging. Whether you're a casual player or a sweaty tryhard like me, Apex Legends delivers endless thrills and moments of pure adrenaline. Highly recommend diving in!",167,True,2,3,1760890052,71011,Apex Legends™,0,

1172470,"I don't like leaving reviews for games but sadly it has come to this.

I came from console, Day 1 player and enjoyed everything the game offered. The gameplay, the gunplay (absolutely superior), and how the characters worked really made this game stand out against other BR games. (Fortnite, PUBG, etc.)
And for a long time this game was great. It did EVERYTHING right. But something happened and now this game is the least amount of fun I have ever had with this genre. 

Identity wise? This game is a former shell of what it used to be. It no longer screams ""Respawn Entertainment"" and shoves ""We will pretend to be them so YOU won't notice."" If you are a casual player - and what I mean is if you like playing this game with friends having a good time and just win or lose? this game will never be for YOU anymore. Since every game seems to only cater to the less than 1% of gamers (The real Esports players) you will hate it. 

This game used to be about dropping in, whether it was Hot drops or far away and still being able to have fun. Now regardless of what mode (Ranked or Unranked) every match is sitting and waiting. or ""Ratting"": for those who care about the actual name for it. Its no longer fast paced fun, its Walking and sitting simulator where you get to hear characters talk among themselves until you either 5th party or ultimately die.

Do not get this review wrong! I enjoyed playing ranked, I enjoyed the other modes and new characters they have added. But if the character isn't meta? You might as well just sit in the menu and listen to the music. Cause that is exactly where you will be 90% of the time. 

EA and Respawns ""Relationship"" with this game is a cancer and for whatever reason... they don't want to give it the proper love it TRULY needs. Its money hungry, as all hell. Split battlepasses? who tf even thinks of something stupid like this? this game has more character skins and new thousand $ heirloom items than quality of life changes. Sadly in typical EA fashion they will never bring this game back to its former glory. Its cheating or nothing with the player-base and its the most unfun I have ever had from being a day one player.

You would have more fun playing an old EA game from the early 2000's than this. If I could refund everything, I would. Please save your sanity, controller,mouse and hell even your monitor the trouble of being broken.",441,False,2,0,1760817850,11602,Apex Legends™,0,

1172470,"Game mechanics sucks, but lore and story-wis,e is great. I like the characters and map design. What I can't get with is the gun mechanics. I've played video games for over 20 years, from Call of Duty and Battlefield to other lesser-known games, such as Counter-Strike. I am really not a fun of slow movement, slow bullet speed. I know many says this game is fast-paced and so on but it is just an illusion. The effects and FOV make you think that but play COD or even bf. There are faster engagements where timing and quick reactions are more important. Now, you might say this makes decision-making better in Apex but not really. If you throw a lot of factors and want to hide different low skills and hope for an RNG win from one or multiple factors, then it is easier. If you know your gun, movements and recoil pattern, then you shall not be RNG into a win/lose situation. I am more into pure physical-based games than software as a limiting factor. What I mean is I prefer my physical body to be the limiting factor and not the game. 

I suck at this game the most from all the FPS shooters and is because of it's software limitations. I can calculate bullet drops, ballistics, different patterns of movements and rotation but here is a RNG fest where your pure skills are limited by RNG and random items. I believe they should help you but not handicap your inner skill.",253,False,0,0,1760766010,16224,Apex Legends™,0,

Its taken only 15 hours for me to get sick of the moronic matchmaking in this game. This is not fun for a solo quewe, and not fun for a noob. The core gameplay is ok, but theres a lot of different tokens, passes, items, upgrades etc etc to learn and can be overwhelming.

The cheating is a little less obvious on this game, but its there, especially with abundant smurfs. I enjoyed the gunplay at range, but up close its worse than COD for having players flying around you like farts in the wind.

In the end my stats showed it will give me maybe 1 in 25 games a fair shot, and the rest of the time im dead so fast its no fun at all. Ive never had such a low K/D in any FPS i played in over 25 years, this is because of the unfair lobbies i find myself in every game. 0.5 K/D is me being whooping boy, most other FPS im over 1 KD.

If you like constant and good (may be) updates, this one’s for you. Try quitting for a while when you come back, you’ll be so confused by all the changes.
Sometimes the updates are great, sometimes they remove the good stuff for no reason.

If you’re not into DEI stuff, this game might still have a bit of that. But if you enjoy fun and fast movement, it’s worth checking out. Personally, I still prefer Titanfall 2, though it’s sad that fewer people play it now.

I believe everyone still dreams of seeing Titanfall 3 someday.

After nearly 5000 hrs across Origin and Steam, I've been through every meta, the highs and the lows, grinding for Pred, tried comp (not good enough to make it tho lol), and was a fan of prime TSM. The state of the game for the past couple of years has been terrible. There were good changes and a lot of bad changes.

TTK
The first thing that I want to address is the current TTK. You might say that I don't adapt to the meta or whatever, but it's not healthy for the game at all, imo. You can peek and die in a second without any way to fight back. It's lowering the skill ceiling and overall NOT fun at all. 
(I still remember, back in 2021, one-clipping people with MNK was really hard and super rewarding but now any one can do that because meta guns can shoot 200 damage in 1-2 sec or 2 shots.)

Free movement??
Movement, oh movement, this is what made me fall in love with this game. Spending hundreds of hours perfecting all the movement tech - wallbounce, super jump, superglide, mantle jump, tap-strafing, Faide slide, etc. etc. (Ik many of them are gimmicky but when you can pull them off to outplay enemies, it makes my brain go monkey mode). Then Apex introduced Ash's dash and Sparrow's jump where with a click of a button, you get free movement with no effort. These abilities make me not want to grind the tech anymore and slowly lose interest in the game.

POOR AUDIO
FFS, the devs mentioned fixing the no-audio bug so many times, but why on earth, in late 2025, do we still get this bug over and over again? You can't even hear the whole team running next to you (check out Monsoon's tweet, the whole team was running and shooting at him with 0 audio in ALGS). Welp, they actually made the footsteps of teammates louder than opponents.

SOLO? Do not play ranked.
We are 26 seasons in, but the devs never mentioned about solo or solo/duo queue lobbies in ranked. Don't they know how unhealthy it is for the game? At least add the option for people to turn it on/off. 
Anyways, I think solo can be enjoyable in low ranks (bronze to plat), but after diamond you will see a significant amount of boosters (low-level, low kill counts, boosting people to Masters), 3 stacking Preds/ex-Preds or Masters running around destroying you. I know some people are good enough to do this challenge, but I'd say it's not enjoyable by any means considering we rarely get comms in this game, at least in the ASIA server.

I might visit the game every now and then to play with friends, but as of right now...

1172470,"**Apex Legends** has arguably the best core gunplay and movement mechanics in the entire battle royale market, offering a fast, fluid, and genuinely high-skill ceiling experience. However, that stellar foundation is constantly sabotaged by years of frustrating, often opaque matchmaking decisions that prioritize queue times over fair play. The ""hero shooter"" element feels diluted, serving more as a veneer for a game that excels at making solo players feel utterly helpless against coordinated three-stacks. While the ongoing content cycle keeps the game feeling fresh, it also suffers from persistent technical issues, most notably inconsistent audio cues, which remain unforgivable for a top-tier competitive title.",104,True,0,0,1760524318,76,Apex Legends™,0,

1172470,"421 hours later, and I’ve realized Apex isn’t just a shooter — it’s a trust exercise gone wrong. You drop in with randoms who either laser entire squads solo or sprint into a 1v3 with a Mozambique yelling “follow me!”.

The gunplay? Absolutely top-tier. Movement? Smooth as butter on ice. Every legend feels unique, and mastering their abilities gives real satisfaction. But man, the third-party fights and matchmaking can sometimes make you want to uninstall mid-air.

When the flow clicks though — you slide, beam, and clutch a 1v3 with red armor — it’s pure adrenaline. That high keeps you coming back.

🎮 Pros:

God-tier gunplay and movement mechanics

Unique legends with diverse playstyles

Frequent events and cosmetics (if you can afford them)

Crossplay that actually works

💀 Cons:
– Matchmaking sometimes throws you against full sweats while you’re solo queueing with two loot goblins
– Server lag and occasional bugs still haunt the game
– Expensive skins and battle passes
– Third parties. So. Many. Third. Parties.

⚖️ Verdict:
It’s frustrating, exhilarating, and addictive all at once. Apex doesn’t respect your time, but it sure rewards your skill.

1172470,"Apex is an Unhealthy Game.

Now before you jump in my throat not knowing what I mean by this, hear me out here, also TLDR is at the bottom.

Apex is such a great game, best BR currently in the gaming world with no competition yet in sight, a lot of people quit playing other games and focused solely on apex and for me it’s one of my fav games and I spent a lot of time on this game since day 1.

But as a lot of you are witnessing as the seasons are going by, apex has become more of a stress game than a fun/chill one, which is due to obvious reasons that I won’t dive into since it has no solution for it in sight and I think it will only get worse from here on end but that stress in itself took a hard toll on a lot of the players behaviors, mental health and some physical health.

Most people who play apex don’t just play for an hour or two, they grind away for hours whether its ranked or to get higher levels/kills in pubs or whatever they are trying to achieve in the game. The gameplay mechanics is certainly addictive based more than any fps game that I played before and can keep you hooked for a long time with match after match like a drug.

Apex has become a stress filled game and that constant stress had started to show on people and players especially on pro/streamer players who spend a lot of time on this game, a lot of them tweet from time to time that they need a break from apex or they will get actually physically sick. Watch a tournament if you haven’t already and see for yourself how each team are screaming loudly in anxiety voice, panics and complete stress with each move. Granted it’s a tournament and money is on the line but again I’ve seen this quite strongly in apex more than any other game.

I had friends who quit the game even though they like it but because it has become so stressful for them to play. The constant anxiety and stress of playing and trying to survive or clutch over and over for hours in lots of matches for example is not something that passes by peacefully on the body and mental health for every person no matter how much you love its adrenaline rush. It’s extremely draining and can be quite harmful on the long run.

The accumulation of this stress for long hours a day, and months on end will show in the form of mental exhaustion and can lead to actual physical health problems. Now you will probably say well its like that with any fps game if it is “over-played” and while that is true, apex is more profound and way faster to show these side effects more than any other game that I have played before.

For me personally, no matter how much of a break I took from the game, weeks or months on end. After coming back to the game and the stress wheel of gameplay starts to get back in motion from grinding away in the game, it was one of the factors (Along with usual life stresses) that got my anxiety problems back, constant tension and even lead to IBS and other stomach problems and I’m back on medications and I’m only starting to show a bit of improvement after I put the game on a long hold. If your life is already stressful, apex can definitely be like adding fuel to the fire and can hasten health issues.

A friend of mine had to quit the game after he started having heart stress related issues when he used to grind the game for hours and days on end trying to rank up. And after he quit, he became much better health wise.

Of course not all people experience that and each person body respond differently to stress than the other person and some even managed to play this game calmly or have nerves of steel but again it’s not for everyone to be able to do that. For apex is more stressful than any other game I have ever played before and I’m sure a lot of people will agree with me on this. Heck i can play titanfall 2 for example with its crazy speed and not have half the anxiety and stress I get in apex.

Aside from broken Sbmm, broken servers and frustrations of gameplay. other reasons in the game and one of the things I noticed and I could be wrong but the people I know who played the game agreed with me on this is that the sounds of the game itself can be very stressful.

Something in the weapon sharp firing sounds, running footsteps of some of the legends “when they are actually heard lol” (for example octane’s squeaky fast robotic legs, or Bangalore’s rapid running footsteps when you are getting pushed by one, some of the weapons and shooting shields sounds can be a bit nerve wracking especially in fast paced end-game scenarios. And since you are also not hearing it just from one team in an area but multiple teams on end one after the other in every match you play as you are trying to survive and score a win.

In general what I’m trying to say here is that be careful and put your health first before apex or any game stress and anxiety filled like that, I’m speaking from an actual experience of mine and others. take lots of breaks in between and minimize your play time so you won’t regret it if an actual health related issue started to show, cause constant stress from a video game or anything else can lead to serious health problems and these problems can sneak up on you no matter how much you feel that you are fine while playing it and in control.

TLDR : Apex can be a very stressful and nerve wracking game and it’s constant stress can cause some serious health issues. Put your health first before it no matter how much you love the game.",1044,False,2,0,1760217633,50712,Apex Legends™,0,

1172470,"Apex Legends is the kind of game that makes you want to scream into your headset, uninstall it in a fit of rage, and then reinstall it five minutes later because you remembered how good it used to be. It’s a battle royale that promised innovation, polish, and excitement — and while it occasionally delivers, it often feels like Respawn is juggling chainsaws blindfolded.
If you’re new to Apex Legends, prepare to be obliterated. The game throws you into matches with players who have thousands of hours under their belts, and unless you’re a Twitch-tier FPS god, you’ll spend your first dozen games as a glorified loot mule. The movement system — while fluid and exhilarating — is also punishingly complex. Slide-jumping, wall-bouncing, tap-strafing… these aren’t just advanced techniques; they’re practically required if you want to survive past the first ring.
There’s no meaningful onboarding. The firing range is a joke compared to what other shooters offer. Want to practice against bots? Too bad. Want to learn how to rotate properly or use cover effectively? Figure it out yourself. Apex assumes you’re either already good or willing to suffer until you are.
Skill-based matchmaking (SBMM) in Apex Legends is like trying to balance a seesaw with a bowling ball and a feather. One match you’re up against casuals who barely know how to reload, and the next you’re facing a full-stack Predator squad that wipes you before you can say “Mozambique here.” Ranked mode is supposed to fix this, but it’s a mess of its own. The point system rewards camping and ratting more than actual combat, and the matchmaking often throws wildly different skill levels into the same lobby.
And don’t get me started on solo queueing. If you’re not playing with friends, expect teammates who drop solo, disconnect mid-match, or loot your death box while you’re still bleeding out. Communication is key in Apex, but the game punishes you for trusting randoms.
Every season brings a new legend, a new weapon tweak, and a new set of balance issues. Some legends are laughably overpowered (hello, Seer Season 10), while others are so underwhelming they might as well be cosmetic skins. The devs seem to swing wildly between buffing and nerfing without a clear vision of what the meta should be.
Weapons follow the same chaotic pattern. One season the R-99 is a laser beam, the next it’s a pea shooter. The Volt gets vaulted, then unvaulted, then nerfed. Shotguns go from reliable to useless in a single patch. It’s exhausting trying to keep up, and it often feels like Respawn is testing changes on live servers rather than doing internal QA.
For a game that’s been out since 2019, Apex Legends still feels like it’s held together with duct tape and hope. Server disconnects are common, especially during peak hours. Audio bugs — like silent footsteps or gunfire that sounds like it’s coming from another dimension — can cost you entire matches. Hit registration is inconsistent, and sometimes it feels like bullets just vanish into thin air.
There are also bizarre visual glitches, like textures not loading or legends T-posing mid-match. And let’s not forget the infamous “code: net” errors that boot you out of games for no reason. Respawn’s response to these issues is usually slow, vague, or nonexistent.
Apex Legends is free-to-play, but it’s aggressively monetized. The battle pass is underwhelming, filled with filler items and grindy challenges. Cosmetics are overpriced — $20 for a skin that looks like a recolor of last season’s? Really? And the heirloom system is borderline predatory. You either spend hundreds of dollars during a limited-time event or hope to get lucky after opening 500 loot boxes.
Even the store layout feels manipulative, with rotating bundles and FOMO-driven sales. Respawn knows players want cool cosmetics, and they’ve built a system that milks that desire for all it’s worth.
The world of Apex Legends has so much potential. The characters are rich with backstories, the setting is tied to the Titanfall universe, and the seasonal comics hint at deeper conflicts. But the game rarely capitalizes on this. Lore is drip-fed through short videos or loading screen blurbs, and most players ignore it entirely.
There’s no campaign, no meaningful single-player content, and no way to explore the world outside of matches. Legends have voice lines that tease relationships and rivalries, but they’re never developed. It’s like Respawn built a beautiful sandbox and forgot to put any toys in it.
For a game that’s been around for years, Apex Legends has surprisingly few permanent modes. Control and Gun Run are fun, but they’re rotated in and out like seasonal decorations. There’s no consistent alternative to battle royale, and that’s a shame — because not everyone wants to spend 20 minutes looting only to die in 10 seconds.
Map rotation is another sore spot. Some maps are clearly better than others (Olympus is a fan favorite, Storm Point is divisive), but players don’t get to choose. You’re stuck with whatever Respawn decides, and that often means enduring weeks of a map you hate.
The Apex Legends community can be brutal. Teammates rage-quit, flame you in chat, or spam pings like it’s Morse code. Ranked grind leads to burnout, and casual matches are often filled with smurfs or people just trying to complete battle pass challenges. There’s little incentive to play for fun, and the competitive pressure can suck the joy out of the experience.
Respawn has made some efforts to curb toxicity — like muting pings or reporting players — but it’s not enough. The game needs better systems for rewarding teamwork and discouraging griefing.
Despite all of this — the bugs, the balance issues, the matchmaking chaos, the monetization — Apex Legends still has something special. The movement is unmatched. The gunplay is crisp. The legends are memorable. When everything clicks — when your squad is coordinated, your shots land, and you clutch a win — it feels incredible.
It’s flawed, frustrating, and often infuriating. But it’s also thrilling, rewarding, and unlike anything else out there.

+ The weapons, combat, movement, skills and characters make this game so fun, with a lot of possibilities!

- There is a dilemma with which mode to play as a solo player: ranked or unranked. Unranked can be fun but generally will be one epic team and a bunch of fodder. 9/10, your team mates have no intention of winning so they leave while knocked which is very frustrating.
Ranked eliminates this problem and people see genuinely motivated to survive at all costs. However, you won't often get an amazingly successful game when you're at your skill limit and it becomes a very frustrating points grind. Particularly when your team will often have some lunatic willing to sprint to Valhalla.

I mostly play with voice chat off which doesn't help this tactical game at all! The amount of insanely angry people who will get killed on their own and then shout at you constantly while you're trying to rescue them (to often die yourself) is just crazy! 

These are hard problems to fix and probably exist in most similar games.

578080,"The game is still fun to play, but it’s gained a dose of “flashiness” — with loads of clothing options, weapon skins, helmets, and similar extras — making it look more like a free-to-play title from some Korean studio that’s focused on farming money through pay-to-win mechanics. In this case, though, it’s more of a “pay-to-look” situation, if that term even exists.

In any case, PUBG can still be enjoyable, but the overloaded menus and abundance of cosmetic items have, in a way, dragged the game down a bit. The core mechanics, however, remain recognizable — the very thing that has kept the game alive for the past 12 or 13 years. Unfortunately, it’s not what it used to be at its peak, but there’s still a solid player base.

I hope the old battle passes make a return, along with the removal of all the unnecessary colorfulness that’s crept into the menus and main screen, and that the map selection system comes back.

So many thousands of people experienced this game's greatness, yet it remains the only place to play with old friends.

If you're a developer reading this review (not just some newbie, but the one responsible for the mindless updates that are killing the game), know that there are hundreds of thousands of people in this world who wish you ill, and you deserve it.
No, I didn't play this game for 200-300 hours and dislike it. I spent 3,500 hours in it and know what it was and should be like. I have every right to consider you talentless parodies of people and hope that karma catches up with you.",183,False,0,0,1762549900,11,PUBG: BATTLEGROUNDS,0,

578080,I bought this game 2 times. First time when it came out on Xbox one. Pretty terrible port. Then 4 years later I bought it on PC for a proper way to play and it runs very inconsistently albeit fine. Its now free and I find myself coming back here and there. Should've been free to begin with IMO if you played the console port. I would recommend only because this is one of the first battle royale games and you can see where the idea came from and its actually a great game when there isnt a cheater in your lobby.,102,True,0,0,1762372210,4614,PUBG: BATTLEGROUNDS,0,

578080,"A few months ago the devs updated the AI/bots. Since then, people are continuing to stop playing this game at an alarming rate. People I have played with for years have all found new games to play. The devs should be able to see this with their own data. I have also been reading that the company that owns pubg wants to become an ""AI first"" company. Great. Keep going. You will end up with random noobs who only stay for a game or two. The game is constantly leaning toward larger maps where you constantly have to drive and drive. Combining different locations in one server and prioritizing vehicles creates an incredible amount of lag. The quest to improve the game is actually doing the opposite. Players leaving in droves, never to return while the devs continue to manipulate the players. I have since the game started and sadly, will not be continuing to play this garbage anymore. Maybe the devs can have ai play ai while they have a circle jerk about what an amazing product they think they have created.",183,False,1,0,1762366611,197269,PUBG: BATTLEGROUNDS,0,

578080,"PUBG — Overrated and Overpriced Chaos

PUBG has always felt like an overrated game to me. For something with such high system requirements, it’s surprising how dated it actually looks — I’ve seen games from 2007 with better graphics and smoother performance.

Gameplay-wise, it’s mostly running, looting, and then getting randomly shot out of nowhere. There’s rarely a real sense of skill or satisfaction — just frustration. It can be fun with friends, sure, but on your own, it quickly becomes repetitive and empty.

Upgrading to Premium was a mistake — total waste of money. And the cosmetics? Feels like they were made for anime fans rather than for a gritty battle royale.

PUBG had potential, but it’s hard to enjoy when everything about it feels clunky, unbalanced, and focused more on microtransactions than fun.",135,False,0,0,1762159520,809,PUBG: BATTLEGROUNDS,0,

if you just play sometimes for fun and spend no money on it then you might enjoy the time you give to it but as a player that plays this game almost daily i am kinda fed up with the map select mode which is random and it is random from the same 3 maps every day and it gets old at this point. No new maps, no option to not run into the same map every day for weeks or months.

If the devs find a way to fix this issue maybe i will change my review but the game at this point is not really a long term type of game since you play the same map every day, probably the last time i have seen Sanhok was last year, since then i have never seen it, i only run into Erangel, Miramar And sometimes Deston but that's pretty much it.

To compensate for these god forsaken decisions, they decided to implement skibidi toilet as an event into the game, which you can participate in for literally no reason or benefit, and there's also an option to pay them a monthly subscription to get absolutely nothing in return, except for cheesy and ugly skins and clothes to equip your character in this absolutely dead game.

578080,"PUBG: BATTLEGROUNDS remains one of the most iconic titles in the battle royale genre, offering a gritty, realistic survival experience that keeps your heart racing from the first drop to the final circle. The gunplay feels weighty and authentic, the map design encourages smart tactics, and every match tells its own intense story of survival and strategy.

Since going free-to-play, PUBG has become more accessible than ever, bringing in a wave of new players and keeping the action lively. However, this shift has also caused some issues — items and cosmetics that were once paid or exclusive have occasionally become free, frustrating long-time players who invested early.

Even with that hiccup, PUBG continues to deliver tense, memorable gameplay and remains a must-play for fans of competitive shooters.

Verdict: A battle royale classic that still delivers — just wish the item system respected veteran players a bit more. ⭐⭐⭐⭐☆",148,True,0,0,1761757769,22113,PUBG: BATTLEGROUNDS,0,

578080,"This one feels like saying goodbye to an old friend. PUBG was one of the first big battle royales that actually felt intense and rewarding — it set the tone for a whole genre. These days though, it’s definitely showing its age. The graphics are mediocre (even for its time, honestly), and while the gameplay is still fun at its core, the clunkiness is really hard to ignore now.

Quick Ratings:
• Graphics: 3/5
• Gameplay: 3.5/5
• Sound: 3/5
• Immersion: 4/5
• Fun Factor: 4/5
• Value: 5/5
• Overall: 3.5/5

When it first came out, PUBG was groundbreaking — nerve-wracking, chaotic, and full of those “just one more round” moments. The tension of hearing footsteps closing in, the scramble for loot, the satisfaction of getting that chicken dinner — it all worked. But time hasn’t been kind to it. The gunplay feels stiff and awkward now, the optimization is still poor after all these years, and the ranked scene in the U.S. is basically dead.

It’s free now, and that helps, but even then, it feels like they’re hanging on by a thread. The seasonal content doesn’t add much, and the small rewards don’t make up for how stale it’s become. It’s not that the game is bad — it’s just been passed by. With newer titles like the latest Battlefield and other modern shooters redefining what large-scale multiplayer can look like, PUBG feels like it’s finally run its course.

Pros:
• Classic and foundational to the battle royale genre
• Still fun with friends, especially in casual matches
• Free to play with some small rewards
• Good sense of tension and immersion

Cons:
• Dated graphics and clunky mechanics
• Terrible optimization after all these years
• Ranked mode is almost unplayable in North America
• Seasonal content is repetitive and low value
• Feels outdated compared to newer multiplayer shooters

All in all, PUBG had a great run. It defined a genre, gave us countless memories, and shaped multiplayer gaming for years. But it’s time has clearly passed — and that’s okay. RIP to one of the originals. It was good while it lasted.",360,True,0,0,1761603528,36128,PUBG: BATTLEGROUNDS,0,

578080,"It's the Battle Royale that started the craze we didn't know we wanted. Overtime it has a smaller player base sure, but it still fits the style I enjoy. The Devs make some weird choices but seem to correct them when the community speaks out. the still actively update and tweak balancing.

The key things from this Battle Royale:
-Realistic movement (as in not a grapple hook and double jump 360 no scope or sliding for half a mile sprays with ridiculous accuracy because the game holds your hand.)
-Recoil is (realistic) as in you have to manually compensate and even then there are shot patterns that make it less like a laser and more like an actual M4 spray.
-A variety of maps, weapons, and blue zone circle spawns that keeps games fresh and different each playthrough.
- All of the paces... what I mean is you have slow catch your breath moments, plan your next move, gear up, and faster paced medium range fights, and really fast close range fights. You just have to figure out which you need in the moment and how to accomplish it. (sometimes you don't need the kill, you need a better position for the next round)
- Mechanics are solid, they take time to get used to because you're not a super human soldier grown in a lab. I'm not talking about bugs so much as the actual mechanics of the game. Often gunplay skill both long range and short range feels rewarding without too much flash or UI noise for a kill or knock.

Key issues with PUBG:
- If you're looking to be a superhuman or have a bunch of special power (that everyone has that picks that class or character) then you're probably not going to like this. It focuses more on positioning, firearms, skill, raw reaction and recoil compensation, sometimes you just get beat because you're in a tough spot, have the wrong gear, or just plain bad luck and there isn't a bunch of mechanics on a hotbar to save you.
- Vehicles for some reason feel way softer and weightless that in the past, always rolling or flipping of little things like the have bad weight ratio and no suspension and it didn't always feel like that. 
- The slow removal of choice. They removed .45cal as a caliber for SMGs, put the DBS shotgun back into crates. overall recent decisions have restricted player choices more than anything for combat preference and skill. SMG go MP5K, Assault go Beryl or M4, Sniping go M24/ or any bolty really, and the ONLY LMG the SAW. (MG is crate i'm talking about found weapons and the poor DP28...I haven't seen one in months, almost years and if i had i overlooked it easily because its garbage, fun, but garbage.)
-Cheaters are still a thing, as with most games, but PUBG is pretty soft on them (probably because of the smaller player base). I think hardware bans is what most of the community of any competitive franchise always want and I'm always confused by Companies that can't understand player retention goes up when the community is fair and strict. 
- In game rewards lean towards loot crates and battle passes for certain items but I do have to give them credit with the fact that a lot of new outfits, emotes, and other skins are purchasable directly through the shop. My main grief with this is progressive skins are loot crate orientated. (plus side is skins mean nothing for actual gameplay other than you are more colorful and easier to see most of the time.)

Conclusion:
I like the game, it's still fun years later and I bought it year one. Community is luckily pretty chill with rare instances of rage or foul talk and you can turn it off it annoys you. Cheaters are what the always are, people who can't actually play worth a dang and want to feel good ruining other people's time. Die quick to them so you can get a better round next match or kill them and laugh internally that you beat someone essentially on roids.
Final thought on the weapons and recent balancing.
In my opinion, instead of starting to put up guide rails so that players only end up using specific meta weapons; they need to expand their game arsenal, like when they added the ACE, Bery. that was heck of a lot of fun to test and play around with. Add more calibers and weapons. ( you already have 5.7mm in the game for the P90, branch our, make the FN 5.7 pistol 20 round mag and does good damage to armor. Switch up what people like about the game and lean in to it, the variety of weapons, calibers, and combat loads people carried made a team feel more versatile and unique i get you don't want to go overboard and create too much diversity which leads to a lot of waste...but you can continue to innovate.

Y'all have fun now you hear.

Игра требовательна к системе, возможны лаги. Однако регулярные обновления, новые карты и исправления ошибок поддерживают интерес. Подходит для любителей экшена и тактики, но новичкам может быть сложно. В целом — отличный выбор для геймеров, ценящих напряжённые сражения и глубокую механику.",87,True,0,0,1761329432,1078,PUBG: BATTLEGROUNDS,0,

Look, I want PUBG to rise again. It's a game that's simple but complex. But nerfing everything just because new players can't keep up is diabolically killing this game. Hundreds of hours of playing, ruined by one update.

If they want to create an easy way for new players to keep up, they should develop better matchmaking. For example, I played on another account that was only Lv. 1, and after just five matches, I was suddenly matched against Level 500, God-tier Master Rank players. How is that possible?

FPS games are difficult. I don't care if someone can't hold their recoil, if you can't, don't play an FPS in the first place.

578080,"My honest review: 3/10

Used to play this game very long time ago when it came out. Back in the day it was fun, but recently I decided to play it again. Played over 100 hours and was fully disappointed.

1. Game does everything to make you to spend more money on new skins, passes, badges etc. I understand that game is free and devs need money, but even with players spending money, devs do not give anything in return. Only thing they update is new skins.
2. Invisible walls. Even if you clearly see the enemy with your scope from the corners of wall, tree, car, etc., bullets still hit invisible objects.
3. Ranked mode that you paid money for - is not ranked at all. Beginner playing ranked ends up playing against the enemy with highest ranks. What is the point of naming something a ""ranked"" without actually adding raking mechanics? (Well.... answer is money)
4. Terrible driving mechanics. Really really bad! Car jumps and flips as if it weight 10kg. Car hits a very very small pit and slips over. This is absurd!!!

The reason I gave this game 3/10 is because I played with friends and we had fun hitting or shocking each other with stun gun, dying together in car crash and so on. Otherwise, I would have given 0.5/10",225,False,0,0,1760994892,6489,PUBG: BATTLEGROUNDS,0,

578080,"I really enjoyed this game. Playing it feels like an incredibly tough challenge that I need to overcome to become better. I also liked the recent event with the zombie mode, which, unfortunately, was removed shortly after; it was fun to spend some time there. Even more amusing was that there were many players in that mode who were literally climbing walls and jumping on invisible textures. I didn’t even realize at first whether it was intended or against the rules.

One downside of this game is the lack of fair matchmaking. This means that in PUBG, you could be a level 1 player, but you’ll be matched with level 500 players who have been playing longer than you’ve been alive. In this game, nobody will spare you; you will likely be told that you are a bad player and insulted if you sit in a corner trying to learn the game. It’s hard to cope with negativity that arises literally from nothing, which ruins the atmosphere. Interestingly, you can do nothing to these players and just die, and they’ll still call you a bad player and try to hurt you verbally. Fortunately, there’s a mute function for irritants.

As I mentioned at the beginning, I really liked this game because, forgetting about the negativity, even in a normal match, you can mess around with friends without any seriousness and throw frying pans at each other. I think that’s what keeps me here, as there’s positivity in that. This game truly has something more than just starting a match, shooting, and lobbies. It’s just pleasant for me.

578080,"During these 7 years of playing PUBG, I never learned to play normally. I won very rarely, my friends helped me win, they killed over 10 players, and I did 0 and only did assists.

I fall from a plane, collect medicine, weapons, ammunition, there is a moment when there are no cars, I walk, a sniper kills me from afar or is hit by a car with enemies. There is also a time when you are exchanging fire with enemies or want to run to a safe zone - your internet connection is lost and you can't reconnect to the current server. From my point of view, this game is most intended for playing with friends, because if you join a squad with random players, no one will listen to you and they will land in another place and die after a short time or leave from the match. If you play in single player mode, there are many players who will be hiding in the bushes or in houses waiting for you with shotguns. There is also very professional players in single player mode, even if you are a beginner. 7-8/10",193,True,0,0,1760782451,312,PUBG: BATTLEGROUNDS,0,

578080,"PUBG — Still One of the Best Battle Royales

Even after all these years, PUBG remains one of the most satisfying and intense battle royale experiences out there. It’s not perfect, but it’s come a long way since launch.

The Good:

Realistic gunplay that still feels unmatched compared to other shooters.

Tactical gameplay that rewards patience, strategy, and skill.

Huge variety of maps and weapons, keeping matches fresh.

Great updates and improvements over time, especially with performance and anti-cheat.

Still delivers that heart-pounding final circle adrenaline rush.


The Bad:

Occasional bugs and desync issues still pop up.

Newer players can struggle with the skill gap.

Some servers can feel inconsistent at times.


Final Verdict:
PUBG may not be the flashiest or most casual-friendly shooter, but it’s still the most grounded and rewarding battle royale for players who want real tension and realism.

Had I kept playing this game on the Mcdonalds' WiFi and a extension cord plugged into the Burger King outlet on the outside of the building I would had never gotten a job. Worse thing ever! I had to get up early, interact with people... I HAD TO DO THIS 5 TIMES A WEEK!.... Horrible experience!!!! Now I'm back to playing hidden in the back of a Kroger.

578080,"Very fun military battle royale  shooter. However, when I downloaded this game I didn't expect anime and ""fortnite"" collabs and now with skibidi coming around this game is sadly not the game I thought it was. Not to mention that 90% of my lobbies contain bots even though in lvl 160. I don't think I have played a single match of solo's without fighting a bot. This game is sadly not what it was from watching videos from the release

If I could I would give this game a 8/10 still, it's the bots and non military cosmetics that ruin it for me. Bots are so prevalent its hard not to give this game a down vote sadly, I just want to verse real people.

Also you can't play third person duos and you can't play solo ranked which is very strange

However the gunplay and strategy this game offers can't be ignored so I have to give this game an upvote",162,True,0,0,1760491878,10120,PUBG: BATTLEGROUNDS,0,

(Tl;dr)  The game is extremely fun, independently if you are playing with friends or alone, but can be considered slow and at times boring for players that aren´t used to a more ""realistic"" Battle Royale. It doesn´t require much skill, but there are many mechanics and resources to learn.

Pros: 
 - Great if you want a great mixture of FPS action and survival mechanics.
 - Good for playing both alone or with friends.
 - Quick to start a match (none of mine took more than 30s to start).
 - If you appreciate some level of realism when it comes to the guns, that can be a good option. It still far from real life, but way more closer than games like Valorant, Overwatch or Apex. 
 - It doesn´t require much skill to play and have fun.

Cons
 - Since it has a more realistic tone compared to many Battle Royale and FPS/TPS games, it can be considered slow and at times, boring. 
 - Even though it doesn´t require much skill, there are many mechanics, strategies and resources to learn that aren´t explained (as far as I know, there aren´t in-game tutorials for those).

578080,"From Running Man with Arnold Schwarzenegger to CaptainSparklez’s Hunger Games Minecraft series, battle royale has always been my jam. There’s just something about throwing a bunch of people into a shrinking map and watching the madness unfold that never gets old.
PUBG nails that feeling. It’s raw, intense, and kind of brutal in the best way. You drop in with nothing, scramble for gear, and hope you don’t get sniped while looting a bathroom. Every match feels like a mini survival movie, and when you finally clutch that win? Pure dopamine.
It’s not the prettiest game out there, and yeah, sometimes the bugs or lag make you want to uninstall. But when it’s running smooth, it’s still one of the most satisfying shooters around. No flashy powers or gimmicks—just you, your squad (hopefully not trolling), and the grind for that chicken dinner.
If you’re into tactical gameplay and don’t mind sweating a little, PUBG’s still got it.",157,True,0,0,1760303233,987,PUBG: BATTLEGROUNDS,0,

How hard is it to catch two guys running next to each other without shooting the other for 15 minutes? Devs cant seem to see this or dont care. Also the only way not to get spotted by ESPers is to hide as low a possible in ditches or in houses. Unfortunately the devs blue wall mechanic is what the cheaters rely on to find you. Oh and the icing on the cake is being matched with a level 2 that pwns because they are a cheater and just created a new account after being banned for using too obvious of hacks. Devs really don't care to check stats or to even make new players play on their own away from veteran players... Easy fixes but MONEY is all that matters. Don't believe the liars that say there are few cheaters, likely they are the ones using ESP and justifing it in their own mind as not cheating.",185,False,0,0,1760286175,44591,PUBG: BATTLEGROUNDS,0,

578080,"[b]TL;DR: Don't let the old 'Mixed' score fool you. The original, clunky, and utterly brutal grand-daddy of Battle Royale is now Free-to-Play, and its core, high-stakes gunplay remains a genre masterclass.[/b]

If you can endure the frustration of a steep learning curve and the occasional cheater, the sheer, heart-stopping adrenaline rush of a final circle in PUBG is still an experience you cannot find anywhere else. For the price of [b]$0.00[/b], this is an absolute must-try for any shooter fan.

[hr][/hr]

[h2]The Grand-Daddy of Battle Royale, Reborn[/h2]

PUBG is not *Apex*. It's not *Fortnite*. It’s a messy, high-friction, military sim-lite that thrives on its own imperfection. While the movement feels heavy and the animations are often janky, this deliberate clumsiness is precisely what makes every engagement a desperate, high-stakes fight for survival. This game forces you to respect the terrain, the sound, and the recoil in a way no other BR does.

The gunplay is, quite simply, [b]unmatched[/b]. Master the recoil patterns, calculate your bullet drop, and landing that long-distance headshot with an 8x-scoped Kar98k feels more rewarding than any kill streak in a faster-paced shooter. Every piece of loot has a meaningful impact, transforming your initially unarmed avatar into a walking arsenal. The decision to go Free-to-Play has made the player base explode again, meaning matches are fast, full, and the action is always close by—even if the map is massive.

[h2]The Consumer Advocate's Caution[/h2]

Now for the inevitable caveats. The overall ""Mixed"" score is largely due to the game's notorious, decade-long struggle with performance and cheaters. While optimization has significantly improved in recent patches, server desync and ping differences can still ruin a gunfight. More importantly, the [u]cheater problem is persistent[/u]. KRAFTON releases weekly ban notices, but you will still inevitably be eliminated by a suspiciously accurate long-range spray. It is the cost of doing business in a high-profile, free-to-play BR, and it remains the single biggest deterrent to a perfect score.

The monetization is aggressive, focusing entirely on cosmetics, Season Passes, and the occasional exclusive currency for specific weapon skins. Thankfully, none of the purchases impact gameplay, keeping the core experience entirely fair. However, be prepared for pop-ups and a dizzying number of cosmetic options if you start poking around the menus.

[h2]Pros & Cons: The Final Scorecard[/h2]

[b]Pros:[/b]
[list]
[*] Unmatched, world-class gunplay that rewards high-skill and patience.
[*] Free-to-Play model provides unlimited entertainment value.
[*] Core tension and adrenaline rush of the final circle is unrivaled in the genre.
[*] Massive map diversity (Erangel, Miramar, Taego) forces constant strategy shifts.
[*] Playing with a squad provides peak cooperative chaos and rewarding teamwork.
[/list]

[b]Cons:[/b]
[list]
[*] Persistent problem with cheaters and poor matchmaking at high skill levels.
[*] Movement feels notably clunky and stiff compared to modern competitors.
[*] Extremely steep learning curve and punishing difficulty for new players.
[*] Aggressive cosmetic monetization that can clutter the UI.
[/list]

[h2]Conclusion: The Chicken Dinner is Worth the Price[/h2]

This is the Battle Royale experience distilled to its purest, most punishing form. It is a slow burn that ignites into a blinding flash of gunfire and adrenaline. Yes, you will get killed by a hacker you never saw. Yes, you will crash your Dacia into a fence post. But when you manage to outplay the final squad, loot the last body, and hear that glorious ""WINNER WINNER CHICKEN DINNER"" sound, every moment of frustration melts away.

[u]💄 The Thrill of the Drop:[/u]

[*]Parachuting into Erangel or Miramar feels like choosing your fate — will it be loot, love, or a lobby exit?
[*]Every match is a blind date with destiny. Sometimes you get a dinner, sometimes you get a frying pan to the face.

[*]Third-person peeking? Naughty. First-person duels? Intimate.
[*]Vehicles add drama — nothing says “romantic getaway” like a flaming buggy flipping through the air.

578080,"The Technical Graveyard: A Review of PUBG: Battlegrounds PC
Title: PUBG: Battlegrounds PC: Eight Years of Technical Debt Overshadowing the Core Experience

Verdict: The soul of the best-in-class Battle Royale gunplay is still here, but it's buried under frustrating server instability, persistent optimization problems, and a frustrating lack of fundamental technical overhaul.

Graphics & Optimization: The Legacy of Low Fidelity
The complaint of ""poor graphics"" isn't strictly about visual quality—many older games still look great—it's about the technical debt inherited from the game's early access days. While Krafton has made visual tweaks over the years, the performance remains notoriously inconsistent.

For a game nearing its seventh anniversary since full release, PUBG is inexcusably difficult to run smoothly. Players with high-end modern hardware are still forced to dive into Reddit threads and external guides to tweak obscure settings, turn off graphical features, and sometimes even use third-party software just to achieve a stable framerate and eliminate the stuttering that cripples close-quarters combat. The visual fidelity itself often feels dated and muddy, failing to match the performance demands it places on a system. It's a game that performs like a next-gen title while looking like one from the last generation.

Bad Servers: Desync and Lag on the Last Circle
The server performance remains a severe, game-breaking problem that compromises the core gameplay loop. Too often, the high-stakes final circles are decided not by skill, but by desync and connection hiccups.

Shots that clearly connect fail to register, players die behind cover they reached seconds ago, and the overall netcode frequently feels sluggish, leading to frustrating and often confusing deaths. While general connectivity might be acceptable for looting, the moment you enter a high-tension gunfight, the lack of server stability turns precise gameplay into a coin flip. The experience is often defined by frustration rather than fair competition, making the skill ceiling feel arbitrary at times.

The Illusion of Upgradation
The claim that the game has had ""no upgradation in 8 years"" is a feeling, not a fact. The developers release new maps, new skins, new vehicles, and new seasonal passes constantly. However, these constant additions often feel like superficial dressing around a decaying core.

Where are the fundamental upgrades?

Movement: Despite minor quality-of-life additions, the character movement remains heavy, clunky, and often unresponsive compared to modern competitors.

Cheating: While the developers constantly issue ban reports, the fundamental anti-cheat measures feel inadequate. Rampant cheating, especially in higher ranks and certain regions, continues to plague the ecosystem, severely damaging player trust and making the experience feel fundamentally unbalanced.

Technical Foundation: New maps are added, but the underlying engine optimization that causes stuttering and poor performance persists.

The focus on continuous content churn (new skins and collaborations) over aggressively tackling the technical foundation and cheating problem suggests a priority of revenue generation over player experience. For a game that pioneered the genre, it’s a tragedy that its aging technology remains the primary barrier to recommending it to new players.

The core tactical challenge of PUBG is still unmatched, but until Krafton commits to a true, ground-up technical overhaul—addressing the optimization, the cheating problem, and the server stability—it will remain a fascinating but deeply flawed relic of the Battle Royale genre.",535,False,1,0,1759862729,11755,PUBG: BATTLEGROUNDS,0,

578080,"During a normal match with friends, we made it to the final phase when my character suddenly teleported across the map and fell from the sky out of nowhere. Seconds later, I was kicked and banned.

I didn’t cheat. What I assume happened, is that I was targeted by a hacker who manipulated my character to make it look like I was using exploits. It’s a known tactic: hackers do this to tilt matches in their favor by getting others banned. Instead of detecting the hacker, PUBG’s anti-cheat system flagged me, the victim. Either that or it was a bug, which would make it even more ridiculous.

When I contacted support, they didn’t even look into it. I got the same copy-pasted response multiple times claiming “every ban is thoroughly investigated,” which is clearly false. If anyone had actually reviewed the match data, it would’ve been obvious to them that I was innocent. And now I'm sitting here with a 3-day ban for ""unusual gameplay patterns"".

I'm being punished for something entirely outside of my control, and the company is doing nothing to fix it, they even make it worse. Their so-called support doesn’t investigate, doesn’t care, and hides behind automated responses.

It’s the most frustrating, unfair, and poorly managed game I’ve ever played. The developers care more about money than their community if you don’t spend, you get nothing meaningful, just useless cosmetic junk and costumes pushing demonic agendas that have nothing to do with a war game.

it’s worth trusting those of us who have played and now rebuke this game for all the emptiness it gives us. I want to save the time of every single new player from this consuming, soulless garbage. I can’t use words strong enough to express how much you should run from it. Believe us when we say this is not worth your time, money, or energy.

If you have great aim and skill and want to jump into a game that makes you feel like the worst player of all time, go ahead. But if you don’t have the experience to support it, you won’t match the one that are chain to this game wasting their lives here I’m not even talking about the hackers, that’s just normal. And if you actually love pain, frustration, and despair, guess what it's still not worth it.

There are so many other games far more better than this one and it doesn't take much to beat it. If you don’t trust those who warn you, be ready for misery, regret, and a toxic experience.

578080,"PUBG… honestly, I have no idea how this game is still alive. The graphics look like something from 2013, yet it somehow needs a super powerful PC just to run without lag — and even then, it still looks awful.

The performance? Trash. The servers? Laggy. The gameplay? Boring, buggy, and outdated. Every match feels like a struggle — not because it’s challenging, but because the game itself is broken.

It’s supposed to be “realistic,” but all it gives you is clunky movement, horrible hit detection, and graphics that look like mud smeared on the screen.

And don’t even get me started on optimization — the game runs worse than most modern titles with triple the quality. Apex Legends, Fortnite, Warzone — literally any other battle royale does everything PUBG tries to do, but better in every possible way.

PUBG is the definition of wasted potential. A game that could’ve been legendary but instead became a laggy, broken, outdated mess. Easily one of the worst battle royale experiences ever made.",170,False,1,0,1759561649,7059,PUBG: BATTLEGROUNDS,0,

well because we didn't have enough money to buy it, hell we even dont have steam
we were all kids 
and then we found a way to play it by renting steam account
we all tried it, we all loved it 
and then we found a way to actually buy the game, and so we did
play this game form 8 grade to grads it was one of the thing that bring us closer, fill our childhood with laugh and joy
but the recent years, this doesnt seem like the game i once played, once enjoy with all of my friends

But if it was a 5 star rating i would only give it a 3-star. Its a fun game. Be prepared to work for your money ....don't beg!! There is plenty of ways to make cash. There will be plenty of ""greifers"" playing to annoy you to tears. Don't carry cash so they don't get a bonus for killing you. Auto insurance is free so don't get bent out of shape when they blow you up. Dust yourself off and move on! Go to the casino every day to spin the wheel for goodies, cash and RP.

271590,"Good game but I cant play it anymore. I would love to try or re-live the others too but rocktstar ruined the whole experience with the steam-link that only they can remove. I went down a rabit hole reading about this problem online. At least hundreds but more then likely thousands of players who have paid their money via steam for the games needing the Rockstar laucher cant play it because Rockstar like to be in control of linking and unlinking steam accounts. 

For example: You didnt play a rockstar game you bought years ago for a while now and you forgot the login or mail to rockstar launcher. Congratiulations! All your Rockstar games on your steam account are worthless now! Even the ones you buy after it. Can you unlink? Yes you can, but they ask the most ridiculous information which almost nobody has laying around anymore. Who does remember the exact moment and date the laucher was linked to the steam account...?  They ask a lot. People who can actually collect the information that is asked to unlink a steam profile often have to wait weeks or months to get a final reaction from Rockstar. I sended a mail 3 times and only got a response once after about 5 weeks. 

So if you buy a Rockstar game and find yourself in this situation with not being able to link an new rockstar launcher account to your existing steamaccount, just return the game. 

For those who are still brave enough and want Rockstar to unlink, you can get a support ticket for this on their website. Steam cant do anything about this, its all a rockstar problem. You could also keep making steam accounts to link to new launchers and keep buying the same games again and again. It seems like Rockstar want you to do that xD",310,False,0,0,1762544418,7774,Grand Theft Auto V Legacy,0,

The streets of Los Santos, the chaos of Heists gone wrong, the late-night drives down Vespucci Beach with the radio on — they all became familiar, almost comforting. We made memories there, whether it was pulling off impossible stunts, getting chased by cops for hours, or just standing on a mountain watching the sun go down.

The online mode is even better, thanks to the massive amount of content the game offers. You can play solo and still have fun, but it’s 10x better with friends, since there’s so much more you can do together.

271590,"Yo, I just tore through Grand Theft Auto V again on the Enhanced Edition, and it's like a decade-old fever dream where three dysfunctional dads turn Los Santos into their personal demolition derby—pure, unfiltered chaos!  Swapping between Michael midlife-crisis golfing, Franklin boosting rides like a pro, and Trevor snorting lines off a chainsaw had me cackling through heists that go wrong in the funniest ways—gold masks everywhere, helicopters exploding mid-air. Story's a satirical gut-punch on American excess, but the open-world freedom? Steal a jet, grief NPCs off mountains, or just cruise beaches blasting radio bangers.
GTA Online's still bumping in 2025 with 40k-90k Steam players grinding heists and yacht parties—mods turn it into Shrek Simulator or flying elephants for troll lobbies that leave me wheezing.

I do love them but I lost access to my old email that was unfortunately used for my Rockstar Games account and now I cannot boot this or any other Rockstar game using their 3rd party launcher (Red Dead, GTA IV, likely GTA VI).

Rockstar support seems to be a team of bots, sending me the exact same copy-pasted message with a different agent in the signature. Despite attaching proof, they just automatically close my ticket and I cannot reply, saying ""We investigated"" and now I can't access games I've spent hundreds of dollars on, and saves I've spend hundreds of hours on. They can't just unlink my Steam account from my Rockstar Games account, instead I can never play something made by them again as long as it uses their 3rd party launcher.

The visuals are cleaner, performance is smoother, and the city feels more alive than ever. Driving, shooting, and just messing around in Los Santos still hit hard after all these years.

It’s not a brand-new experience, but it’s the best version of a classic — a proper tribute to a game that defined a whole generation.

271590,"This game fascinated me even before I truly understood the concept of gaming. After 11 years, I finally got the chance to play it — and it absolutely lived up to the hype. GTA V has become, and will always be, one of my favorite games of all time.

I’ve spent over 100+ hours on the Enhanced Version, which is great in its own right, but the Legacy Version has a unique vibe that the newer one can never quite replicate.

The Story Mode is simply goated —
 I often find myself doing random stuff just to chill and relax. On the other hand, GTA Online feels like an endless grind with too much content to keep up with.

If I had to choose, Story Mode easily beats GTA Online for me.

Overall:

[h3]Story[/h3]
You play 3 characters in virtual Los Angeles. You'll commit several crimes and solve problems, that arise for such a lifestyle. Good story, nice Eastereggs. Classic cultural commentary included. The story is fun, generally up-beat and a bit superficial. More like GTA San Andreas than GTA IV.

271590,"I Aint Installing Some Spyware (BattlEye) Just To Play GTA Online!!!

After thousands of hours in Los Santos, I should feel rewarded, not punished. But the latest BattlEye anti-cheat update in GTA Online feels less like protection and more like betrayal.

Rockstar promised a cleaner, fairer GTA Online experience with kernel-level BattlEye integration, claiming it would finally curb the endless wave of modders and griefers. In reality? Modders still roam free, while honest players are forced to install invasive, kernel-level software that digs deep into our systems and offers little in return.

The result: no meaningful improvement, just another layer of inconvenience for the very community that’s kept this decade-old game alive.

BattlEye: Security or Surveillance?

Now we’re asked to trust Rockstar with kernel-level access to our PCs — the same Rockstar that can’t balance mission payouts or prevent cheaters from raining cash in public lobbies. BattlEye was supposed to stop the madness, yet modders still teleport, crash sessions, and ruin lobbies daily. The only difference is that now legitimate players are the ones facing crashes, false positives, and privacy concerns.

It feels like a cruel joke: the cheaters are fine, and the loyal players are the ones under surveillance.

A Veteran’s Verdict

After thousands of hours of gameplay, I can say this with conviction: GTA Online has lost its soul. What was once chaos in a fun way has turned into corporate monotony disguised as gameplay. The grind is endless, the missions are lifeless, the prices are absurd — and now the anti-cheat punishes the wrong people.

BattlEye was meant to fix GTA Online. Instead, it just exposed how far Rockstar has drifted from the players who built this world in the first place.

Problem About The Game:
The Economy Designed to Exhaust You

Earning money in GTA Online has become a grind that borders on parody. Every activity feels like a chore — the same tired missions recycled for the hundredth time, paying next to nothing for hours of work. Even the cheapest vehicles are priced like luxury sports cars.

When a rust-bucket sedan costs millions, you know the economy is broken. It’s a system designed to frustrate players into opening their wallets. The game’s grind is no longer about progress; it’s about testing how much tedium you can endure before you give up and buy Shark Cards.",390,False,4,0,1761354631,26242,Grand Theft Auto V Legacy,0,

271590,"Grand Theft Auto V isn’t just a video game — it’s an experience that pulls you into a living, breathing world filled with ambition, chaos, and beauty. Set in the sprawling city of Los Santos, Rockstar Games delivers a world so detailed and alive that every street corner tells a story.

From the moment you begin, the game’s three protagonists — Michael, Franklin, and Trevor — take you on an unforgettable journey of friendship, betrayal, and the pursuit of the American dream. Each character offers a unique perspective, blending humor, emotion, and action in a way few games ever achieve.

The gameplay is endlessly diverse — whether you’re planning heists, racing through the streets, exploring mountains, or simply watching the sunset over the Pacific Ocean, there’s always something new to discover. And with GTA Online, the experience expands into a limitless world of creativity, competition, and connection with players across the globe.

Even years after its release, GTA V remains a benchmark of open-world design. Its stunning visuals, dynamic storylines, and incredible attention to detail make it not just a game — but a timeless piece of art that continues to inspire gamers everywhere.

⭐ Verdict:
🎮 A true masterpiece that blends story, freedom, and realism like no other.

271590,"GTA V remains a landmark title in open-world game design, and its Steam version (especially the Enhanced PC edition) keeps it relevant years after launch. Between the sprawling single-player campaign and the live, evolving multiplayer, you get an immense amount of content and freedom.

At its core: if you’re buying a big open-world sandbox for PC, GTA V is still among the very best. The glitches and ageing systems are real but overshadowed by the strengths.
Just go in with the understanding that: you’ll need Rockstar’s launcher/Social Club, online mode may vary depending on platform, and the choice between single-player vs online is yours to make.

If I had to distil into one line: GTA V on Steam is a must-play for sandbox lovers, still hugely fun in 2025 — just be ready for some launch-ecosystem quirks and massive scope.

271590,"The Rockstar Games Launcher is really frustrating. After completely installing the GTA 5 Legacy version, I tried to play the single-player mode first. But apparently, I have to sign up just to play single-player mode? That’s weird, but fine.

The real problem started when I tried to sign up. I got this error message:
“Sorry, we are unable to handle your request at this time.”
Error code: #1.500.7

According to Rockstar’s official support, this issue can supposedly be fixed by checking if your network or internet service provider is using a proxy or VPN. But my connection is perfectly fine—I’m not using a proxy or VPN at all.

What’s worse is that when I try to submit a support request to Rockstar, they require me to log in… which I can’t do because of the very same issue. I’ve already tried every solution I could find online and in the community, but nothing works.

I was really excited to play GTA 5, but this has been a very disappointing experience with the Rockstar Games Launcher.",175,False,0,0,1760803687,79,Grand Theft Auto V Legacy,0,

However, customer support is a serious downside. When I lost access to my email account, Rockstar refused to help recover my account, which is extremely frustrating given how much time and money can be tied to a Rockstar profile. It’s disappointing that such a fun game comes with such a risky support system.

271590,"When I think of GTA V, I remember a feeling (of seeing it first advertised and then playing it), rather than the individual missions or activities this game has to offer. 

And this game has a lot to offer regarding content - with the single player campaign being quite extensive and then ofcourse GTA Online for those wishing to bankrupt or frustrate themselves. 

I remember all the announcements for this game, the gameplay trailers and showcases and then finally when the game came out. I believe we got the game on Xbox 360 but what my brother and I were really waiting for was the PC port. When that hit in 2015 we were both locked in and played non stop until we were burnt out on it. Which was a long time after completing the game.

Most of what we experienced was amazing - the graphics, the main gameplay loop (cover shooter, driving), the design, and the set pieces. The scope of the game, with regards to the side missions and activities were overwhelming. The scale of the map was also insane. I think the only thing I felt lacking was the story - and this is me reflecting some time after finishing the game. While playing I didn't quite feel dissatisfied but upon reflection I think the gimmick of 3 playable characters was awesome but also slightly working against itself. Having a singular identity and progressing through the story as such in previous games felt awesome. Here the set pieces and mission design was a lot better but not as impactful in the end I feel. I can't really remember the story end. 

Had a blast in any case and when first person view was introduced it felt like a completely different game. Got more than my money's worth and dabbled in GTA Online for a bit until the big spenders and cheaters annoyed me. Or just general trolls on heist missions - great concept and execution from Rockstar but the nature of humanity ruined it for me. Had more fun on single player stuff in Online. 

If anyone hasn't tried it yet, I would still recommend it now. It still outperforms many games to this day. Just stick to the single player campaign.

Online:
Its a fun version of GTA 5 but there are so many bugs like on the heavy armour bunker mission in the diamond casino heist were there are just invisible walls for no reason(can't kill the enemies behind it) or even the optimisation of online is terrible and for a 12 year old game that receives updates it should be better, and the grind for this game now is crazy i've been playing online for 6 years now and its horrible. 5/10

271590,"The introduction of BattlEye was the death of the GTA franchise to me.  Enjoyed both 5 and online, many hours played, quite a few of those avoiding cheaters (not so hard) and the more egregious griefer who enabled by RockStar would have all sorts of toys - cages ffs.  But even so, most of the time little Timmy would either get bored or have to go to bed before me.  I've always enjoyed the persistent rich map of GTA, from the apartments, bases, clubs, getting lost on a highway turn off, getting out the car and treking over a mountain for no reason.  Bought the odd Shark Card, but generally made a success of playing the game.

However to be told one day they'd introduce a known poor anti-cheat mechanism that wouldn't even solve the original problem - and don't worry, sure they've got access to your entire computer, but they're good guys, honest - drop your pants and they'll ensure everything is ok... WTF!!!

This was I think was back in November/December of 2024, desperate to see if a revolt would encourage a back-track, apparently not.  Still even the off-line game requires BattlEye is install - the offline game!

So today I come to part-ways and let it go, reclaim some HDD space at least.  Was a dead cert for GTA6, now there's no way I'll be buying, hell if it was entirely free I'd not be interested in either the risk of it being ripped away or mandated to drop my pants and cough for BattlEye et al.  I've enjoyed quite a few RockStar titles, but with the idea they might do the same, I'll probably avoid them entirely.",281,False,0,0,1760275384,50793,Grand Theft Auto V Legacy,0,

Review for the story only: Really good game, although the story was kind of blame and a lot of the missions are scripted and fail if you do anything slightly different this is the most complete and complex GTA game so far.

me and my cousin playing, we in the game in a mission and about to fly the Helicopter!, the mission was hard tho, I was the pilot and he was the co-pilot, 
before we took off, he said ""PLEASE FLY CAREFULLY!"" like seriously, cuz he know... I kinda go crazy when driving or flying.
and then... after like ""5 seconds"" of taking off, I ""accidently"" crashed and blew up the Helicopter and we died xDDD
The reaction on his face was unbearable he almost killed me xD, I was laughing soo hard I couldn't even breath haha
And the funny thing that this was an accident!... I accidentally hit something while I was taking off and it blew up the Heli LMAOOOO and we had to repeat the hardest part of the mission again.

271590,"“Still the best life simulator for people who don’t want a criminal record.”

After 400 hours, I’ve built an empire, blown it up, and spent most of my fortune trying to land a jet on the freeway “just to see if it works.” 
It didn’t.

Los Santos is chaos therapy — part crime sandbox, part social experiment, all running on caffeine and poor decisions.

Ten years later and it’s still the only game where you can steal a tank, call your therapist, and get sniped by a twelve-year-old from Norway in the same minute.

271590,"A cultural landmark in gaming—a sprawling satire of modern life wrapped in chaos, ambition, and dark humor. Its world, Los Santos, feels alive in every sense: from the glimmer of downtown skyscrapers to the dusty stretches of Blaine County. What makes it remarkable is its balance of freedom and storytelling—three characters, three lives, one unforgettable criminal symphony.

Even years later, it continues to evolve through GTA Online and community creativity. Mods, roleplay servers, and player-made stories have turned it into something far beyond its original design. GTA V isn’t just a game anymore—it’s a living digital city, endlessly reborn through the imagination of its players.",105,True,0,0,1759974323,7859,Grand Theft Auto V Legacy,0,

271590,"This game is amazing but I started playing GTA Online Roll Play FIVE M and I got mistakenly banned, Pecado City server accused me to be a Hacker and the admins were totally unprofessional ruining me my experience as a new player, tried every way possible to show that they were mistaking me but they threw me out anyways with no way to explain myself, I demand to talk to a supervisor because like I said ruined my experience and I'm leaving this review so new players can be careful with role play FIVE M online and not get their experienced ruined like happened to me, I highly advise Rock Star to pay more attention to FIVE M because I will not play this game anymore and others will follow as well.",132,False,0,0,1759937869,66,Grand Theft Auto V Legacy,0,
